            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15177:6"/>they were not acquaynted with their manner of fyghte: for when the Frenchmen with a certaine feruour of fyghte, did more egrely purſue the Gréekes, at once both couragiouſly charging, and alſo with great arte fléeing backe, and thereby did breake their array: the Gréekes did ſuddaynely againe returne into the fight, and then many of them and light, did ſet on the Frenchmen, being diſperſed one from another, and laden with armour, and alſo vnwarelye floung forward, and ſo eaſely beate them down wyth their hooked and very heauie Turkiſh ſwords or mawles of yron. <hi>Gonzaga</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Horſemen wéeried with a long and paynefull iourney, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked them from purſuing of the enimies vnto their Campe: and contented with this good ſucceſſe, returned vnto the army, all his men being very ioyfull, and manye bearing the heads of the Frenchmen vpon their Launces.</p>
            <p>Among the Priſoners was there taken one <hi>Ante,</hi> a Captayne of a band of Switzers, a man wel knowen before time to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Earle of <hi>Giazza.</hi> He politikely lying, did augment the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the french Horſemen and footemen that were in the auantgarde, for to feare the Italians from oppreſſing them, who had ouerboldly marched before their felowes, and alſo falſely affirmed that the King wyth the middle battell, and <hi>Seigneur de Tremouille</hi> with the rerewarde, were not farre off, the which lye doubtleſſe ſaued Marſhall <hi>Gien,</hi> who diſtruſting the ſmall number of his Souldiers, and they alſo diſordred with the ſkirmiſhe, had got him into an high place, that there in his camp defenſed by all meanes he coulde, he might ſtay for the King, yea though he followed after ſlowly. But when thys occaſion of deſtroying the vaantgard did ſeeme vnto ſome to bée offered as a meane to obteyne afterwarde an abſolute victorie of the King, the Marques of <hi>Mantoa</hi> was of the mind, that nothyng ought to bée then attempted, but in any caſe the reſt of the Kings power was to be ſtayed for, that when the King their enimie were in ſight, they mighte more ſafely and nobly fight with hys whole power in a pitched field: for the Italian army did excéede them in number, and it ſéemed that they woulde alſo haue ouermatched them in the battel, if that fortune had not fayled them, who ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſwarued from the diſcipline of their aunceſtours.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:15177:6"/>
            <p>Thus the Kyng hauing gotten the ſpace of the whole nexte daye, and tymely ouertaking the vauntgard, encamped at <hi>Forono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uo.</hi> Betwéene the two Campes ranne the riuer of <hi>Tarro,</hi> whyche falling down violently fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtiepe Appenine Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taynes into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> encloſed valleys beneath, with a rocky and vnequall Channell, at length hauing gotten the open fields, runneth into the <hi>Po.</hi> The Venetians encamped on the left ſide on the broader banke of the Riuer, not farre from the Village <hi>Appiano,</hi> in the lower grounde: but the Frenchmen on the right, hauing on their lefte hande the Towne <hi>Medeſano,</hi> and being on the higher hylles, they myghte eaſely ſee the Camp of their enimies, which by reaſon of the great number of tentes pitched round about, gaue a ſhew vnto the eyes of the wondering Frenchmen of a very great army.</p>
            <p>When the King ſaw himſelfe and his army brought into ſuche a place, as out whereof there was no hope left to eſcape, vnleſſe victorie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> became his guide: to aſſay the intents and mindes of the <hi>Prouiditori,</hi> he ſente an Herald to requeſt of them truce for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dayes.

The Herald being brought vnto the <hi>Prouiditori</hi> and Captaines, ſaide, that his maiſter did greately wonder, that the Venetians, whome he had not prouoked by any iniurie, were come with ſuche a power of warlike menne to impeache his returne into <hi>France,</hi> that his Maieſtie did requeſt, according vnto the iuſt lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that with truce they would help his army, as it trauayled, with victuals for money, and ſuffer them with quiet iourney to paſſe into <hi>France:</hi> if they would thus doe, then his maieſtie was to giue greate thankes vnto the Seigniorie of <hi>Venice</hi> and their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, but if they would not, then the French Souldiours would not onely open a way for themſelues by true proweſſe, but alſo make a cauſey for theyr King wyth the ſlayne carcaſſes of the

Finally there were fewe, who thought that the life and libertie of the King was raſhly to be putte into the daunger of vnequall fyghte, when there was no man founde that béeyng more wofull for the Kings ſafetie, than for his owne, was not of the opinion, that the euent of the battell woulde bée farre worſe than all other things: in ſomuch that they ſéemed vnable eyther to fynde ende to theyr aduices, or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red meane to ſaue the armye in that daunger.

Doubtleſſe I ſee, that the ſame one only counſell is both ſafe and honorable, whiche dothe ſéeme vnto other moſt hard and daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, namely, that abandoning all thought of peace or flighte, wée make vs a way with our ſwords: Neither bycauſe that I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that in the ſucceſſe all things will be eaſie for you, nor do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of the victorie, would I ſéeme to foreſée in mind more than the reſt, and more arrogantly to forefeele the whole euent of thys inſtante matter, for this may be graunted not vnto my witte, but vnto my practiſe in warfare, and experience of Italian affayres, ſith that for the ſpace of theſe many yeares, I haue bin preſente in all the warres of <hi>Italy,</hi> whereby it was not hard for me aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to learne the counſels, mindes, artes, and the verye diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, both of the Princes, and alſo the Captaines and ſouldyers thereof: all which things haue at the length with my often not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure perils, ſo taught and inſtructed me, that they haue made mée neyther, fooliſhe-hardie, nor altogither fearefull. Firſt of all wyll not I beléeue that whiche doth ſo vehemently feare their hartes, that are moued with the greateneſſe of the daunger, that is, that the Venetians will of their owne accorde bidde vs battell, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that ye vnderſtand by the letters of certaine, that the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenantes and Captaynes haue no commiſſion from the Senate to fight, who will beléeue that a people of nature giuen long to lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and draw forth warres, will for an other mans cauſe; without any their neceſſitie, hazard all their power in a pitched fielde: for it is too too fooliſhe for a common wealth that doth flouriſh in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting wyſe Counſellours, and ryches that cannot bee conſumed, to couet gay triumphes by a doubtfull and bloudy battell, when they may, and not raſhly looke for the mature and certayn victorie of the vniuerſall warres, that are not feared with the great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of them. Neyther indéede do I thinke that <hi>Lewes Sforza,</hi> a man of nature fearefull, ſuſpitious, and very wary, dothe earneſtly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15177:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>by his ſecret counſel, to haue the french power quite deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Venetians.</hi> For what other ende will there come of that victorie (which God forfende) than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Duchie of <hi>Milan</hi> become a bootie vnto the <hi>Venetian</hi> victor, which they by inuading and tearing with impotent armes, haue alwayes with ſingular couetouſneſſe deſired? But admitte that <hi>Lewes</hi> will do nothing to day as a wiſe and wary man, and that the <hi>Venetians</hi> by a new and ſuddayne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell wil committe the Empire of <hi>Italy</hi> to the arbitrement of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Mars:</hi> is there any doubt therefore (couragious Soueraigne <hi>Charles</hi>) to be made of the victorie? let vayne feares departe from valiant heartes, ſéeyng that all things that euery good Chiefetaine doth wiſh to haue when he ſhall fight, do promiſe vnto vs vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hope of good ſucceſſe. Firſte of all, a cauſe paſſing good, faithfull and olde Souldyers, greate ſtore of ordinance, a very indifferents place, and finally regarde of none other thing, but common ſafetie and glory. The proweſſe of the Italian Souldyers héere to day neyther do I debaſe nor extoll, for I ſhould do foudly or impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if I ſhould vtter my iudgement thereof, ſo that kéeping ſtill my ſhamefaſtneſſe vnuiolated, I doubt not to confeſſe and affirme this one thing, that we ſhal deale with an army of freſh water Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and of <hi>Omnigatherum:</hi> for the greateſt part of thoſe Horſemen whom we ſée gliſtering in their creſtes and armoure, haue neuer put on armour before, but at a pomp, when that armes were mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, and in ſporting fightes and ſhewes: nor euer heard ſound of Trumpet: for indéede, there haue bin no warres in <hi>Italy</hi> theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, nor no iuſt and bloudy battell foughten: but the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will not only not ſuſteyne the force of the Almayne Eſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, but being inferiour both in armour, weapons, and courage, will not abide ſo much as the ſight of them, comming vpon them with ſo great order and array. Then there remayneth that we do greately feare the artes and ſuttle policies of ſome olde beaten Chiefetaine. Alas what ambuſhe will he lay, or with what array will he bring forth his army through the incommondious fordes of the rough riuer, to inuade vs marching in array of battell? a ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Chiefetayne that neuer ſawe Campe of Souldyers beſydes this of hys owne, wherevnto he is preferred rather for the title of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15177:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>his name, than for merite of tryed proweſſe? Therefore mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is (inuincible Kyng) that we marche on ſtill forwarde as we haue begun, and your maieſtie ſhall doe well, if that you do adhort the Souldyers not to doubt of the euent of the battell, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne their enimies. The baggage of the army being ſente away a little diſtance from the armed rankes on the left hande towards the hilles, woulde I purpoſely obiect to be ryfled by the enimie, who is more gréedy of pillage than of fight. On the ryghte hande towardes the ryuer, let the greate ordinance be placed agaynſt the enimies. I with my college <hi>Gien</hi> will leade the fore warde; and the way, and béeyng néereſt to daunger, wyll valiantly ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, that it nothing repent youre hyghneſſe to haue followed this counſell: the reſt of the martiall charges lette the Captaynes (and ſpecially the auntient) parte amongſt them, and lette them marche forward vnto victorie with the armye prepared for both chaunces of battell and trauayle: for neyther their wonted vertue, nor youre fortune ſhall fayle them, who being made noble by perpetuall vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, haue learned to fight valiantly, yea, and if it were but for only glory.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Trivulzi</hi> had pronounced this Oration, with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance full of confidence, no man almoſt ſéemed (although in ſome of their heartes feare were fettled) which did not chéerefully aſſent to his ſentence, and ſwore that they woulde not departe the fielde but victors. Then <hi>Charles</hi> diſpoſing hys Horſemen, to repreſſe from all partes the <hi>Greekes,</hi> who almoſt euery houre with great cryes, ſtirred vp ſundry tumultes in his Camp, and watching almoſt the whole night, the next morrow as ſoone as it was fayre day, brake his faſt, and commaunded the Souldyers to doe the ſame, and to prepare both their bodyes and hartes as well to fight, as to march forward: and not long after he béeing cladde rather in ſtrong, than fayre armoure, mounted on Horſebacke, enuironed with ſeauen yong Gentlemen of approued fidelitie and prowes, armed, apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and trimmed in all poyntes like vnto him ſelfe. As hée ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Souldyers ſaluted him with ſo chéerefull voices and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, that they interrupted him when he began to encourage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: beſieching hym to haue no doubt of the victorie, whiche they had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15177:9"/>now in their hands. For when he was on Horſebacke, he ſéemed to be taller and more liuely tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was indéede: for of nature he was a very little man, and by reaſon of his olde diſeaſe, weake, and not ſtrong legged to goe on foote, but then he looked lyke vnto a valiant and feareleſſe Souldioure, for his face, eyes, and ſpecially hys hawkes beked noſe. There guarded him on both ſides two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of noble Horſemenne, with whome were intermingled the guard of Scottes. Moreouer, <hi>Mathew</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baſtard of <hi>Burbon,</hi> in whom the Kyng repoſed very greate truſt, and <hi>Robinet Frameſell,</hi> the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant conductor of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his men of armes, enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with theyr companyes of Horſemen, one on the right ſide, and the other on the left. There followed aboute a two furlongs behinde them, the thirde and the laſt battell, the conduct whereof had <hi>Foix,</hi> a noble man of <hi>Guien,</hi> and <hi>Seignieur de Trimouille,</hi> who afterward for his great actes, became a renowmed Chiefetayne. With them was a great power of excellent Horſemen. But in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vantgarde were ſéene the Eſquadrons of the Switzers and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, their chiefeſt hope and ſtrength, and the great ordinance. The Marſhall <hi>Gien</hi> and <hi>Trivulzi</hi> marched before with a companie of light Horſemen, to ſhew the way vnto them that followed. An arrow ſhot behinde them followed the Switzers and Almaynes, to whome their Colonels <hi>Gilbert</hi> of <hi>Cleue,</hi> and <hi>Antony Baſſey,</hi> men ſkilfull of their tungs, had promiſed in the Kings name treble pay, if that they ſaued the King by their faithfull and valiant handes.</p>
            <p>Wyth them on the left hand were ioyned the <hi>Gaſcoignes, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſtes,</hi> and almoſt thrée hundred archers of the guarde, who tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough vnlucky counſell, had ſent away theyr Horſes, and marched on foote, that they might ſhoote the more ſtrongly. But the greate ordinance béeyng drawen with equall pace cloſe to the batallion of the footemen, were placed againſte the riuer, and the battels of their enimies.

            <p>All his whole hoſt was deuided into nine battels, the number of his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were aboue two thouſand four hundred men of armes, a few leſſe than two thouſand lighte Horſemen, and about twelue thouſand footemen.</p>
            <p>In the firſt battell was <hi>Peter Dodo</hi> a <hi>Venetian</hi> with ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gréeke Horſemen, and <hi>Aleſſo Beicacuto</hi> with almoſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Archers on Horſebacke, who did not vſe howes of woode as did the Frenchmen, but croſſebowes of yron.

            <p>In the ſeconde battell was the Earle of <hi>Giazza</hi> with the power of <hi>Milan</hi> for this conſideration, that as ſoone as <hi>Trivulzi</hi> and <hi>Gien</hi> were encountring with the lighte Horſemen, he vppon the ryghte ſide ſhould ſet vpon them, being then occupyed and troubled.

But yet the Spaniſhe footemen, béeyng forſaken of the Horſemenne, foughte with incredible fierceneſſe, who although they hadde bin a little driuen backe at the fyrſte encounter wyth the Almaynes, by reaſon of the ſtrong rankes of theyr pykes, yet after they came within the length of theyr Swordes, and manye of the Spanyardes béeyng couered wyth Targettes, hadde gotte betwéene the legges of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, thruſting them in, in thoſe vnarmed places wyth theyr daggers, and commyttyng a greate ſlaughter, they were nowe come almoſt vnto the middes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battel, among whome, the Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coigne footemen hauyng gotten the way betwéene the Riuer, and the Rampyre, had charged the Italian footemenne, who although they hadde receyued greate loſſe by the greate ordinaunce, yet hadde repelled them to theyr ſingular commendation, if <hi>Alegres</hi> hadde not gyuen a violente charge on them wyth hys Horſemen, wyth greater force, than good fortune: for when hée ſawe hys ſonne <hi>Viuerroes</hi> ſlayne in his ſyght almoſt at the very fyrſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hée vnwillyng to lyue after ſo greate griefe, flang in wyth hys Horſe into the thyckeſt of hys enimies, and fyghtyng as became a moſt valiaunte Captayne, after he had ſlayne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, was ſlayne hymſelfe.</p>
            <p>The Italian footemenne, when they coulde no longer ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyne ſo greate a multitude, beganne to ſhrinke, but parte of the Spanyardes commyng to theyr ſuccoure, they kepte ſtyll in the battayle, and the Almayne footemenne béeyng oppreſſed by the other parte of the Spanyardes, coulde ſcarſe ſtande vppe anye longer. But nowe all the Horſemenne

The greateſt part of the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that eſcaped out of the battell, fledde vnto <hi>Ceſena,</hi> and from thence vnto farther places, neyther dyd the Viceroy ſtay anye where, before he came to <hi>Ancona,</hi> whither he brought but very few Souldyers, many béeing ſpoyled and ſlayne in their flight, for the Duke of <hi>Vrbine</hi> not only ſtirred vp the Countreymen againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo ſent Souldyers to doe the like in <hi>Peſaro,</hi> they only eſcaped ſafely that paſſed through the dominions of the Florentines.

But the Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers (to the end they might make a ſhew, that they meant ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than that they intended indéed,) commaunded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to be ſounded all the whole night, now in this part of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and nowe in that, to make the eſpyes, if there were any in the Citie, to beléeue that they would iſſue out of the Towne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by kéepe their enimies, who they knewe had bin in armour all the whole day on Horſebacke, armed alſo all the night long. But they commaunded all their owne men to ſtrengthen their bodyes wyth fléepe, and to ſtay for day, that euery man might in the cléere lighte ſhewe his valor, with a noble contention for honor. For theſe are the moſt ſeuere lawes of the Switzers, that whoſoeuer ſhall in the ſight of the armie doe things for feare, whiche are ſhamefull and vnméete for valiaunt menne, ſhall be incontinently ſlayne by their nexte fellowes, ſo that the greater feare doth ouercome the leſſe, and for doubt of a ſhamefull death, an honorable death is not feared. Now a little before it was light, the Captaynes choſe out of all their armie (whiche was about nine thouſand footemen) one thouſande men of approued proweſſe, who ſhould haue the charge of eyghte falkons, and accompany <hi>Maximilian</hi> and his Horſemen, who were very fewe, but of the chiefe of the nobilitie. The reſt dyd caſt themſelues into two battels, and marched all whyſt without ſounde of Drumme towardes their enimies two diuers wayes. But <hi>Triuulzi,</hi> who although he were accompted a Captayne of approued and beaten wiſedome, yet thoughte nothing leſſe than that a few, and thoſe weary footemen, woulde before <hi>Altoſaxe</hi> were come, iſſue out againſt a very ſtrong power, or attempt any thing touching the fortune of the battell. When he vnderſtoode that the enimies power was in ſyght, reyſeth vp <hi>Tremouille,</hi> and the reſt of the Captaynes, commaundeth the ſignals to be ſounded, &amp; the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be placed againſt the enimie, and all things that he hadde learned by experience and diſcipline, to be adminiſtred according
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15177:32"/>to the neceſſity of the perill. The ſhorteneſſe of the tyme was ſuche, and the heartes or the enimies ſo ready to fighte, that the Frenche horſemen had ſcarſe tyme to bridle their horſes, and put on their heade peeces: as they which had ſtoode a greate parte of the day and night in armour, attending what ſhoulde bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them: and at length thoughe very late, when newes was broughte that all was quiet at <hi>Nouara,</hi> had gotte them into their cabines to take their reſte. But the light horſemen, as men ſooner ready, in good time enoughe ranne forth with a very long wing ſtretched towards the lefte hande, and mette with the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande Switzers as they were commyng, who, that they mighte auoide the greate ordinaunce, that nowe tempeſted vppon them, marched towardes the riuer of <hi>Mora,</hi> fetching a little compaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute, and then minded to paſſe ouer the riuer by a bridge, and ſet vppon the backes and tentes of the enimies. Thus the Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers marching on towardes the bridge in a broade waye, beganne to be torne in peeces with the ordinaunce whych flanked them on the ſide, and to be vehemently preſſed by the horſemen. But then <hi>Mottine</hi> wyth vnappalled hearte altered hys counſell, and willed <hi>Maximilian</hi> (who was in great danger, the <hi>Epirotes</hi> inſulting rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about him) to depart out of the fight, and incontinently to returne vnto the Citie, that ſo he might keepe the heade of the warres, which then laye open vnto the acerbitie of fortune, for to enioye the noble hoped victory. But when hee nobly refuſed ſo to doe, and with conſtant hearte deſired that he might be ſuffered to take the chaunce of common fortune, two pety Captaines, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye enſigne bearers, tooke his horſe by the bridle, and pulling off the creſt from his helmet, and caſting about hym an olde cloke to bide his coate armoure, ledde him out of the field, forcing him to returne vnto the citie with a troupe of horſemen, that hee beyng a daungerleſſe beholder of their proweſſe, myghte there exſpecte the newes of ſpeedy victory. <hi>Mottine</hi> being thus deliuered of that wofulneſſe, relieth his ſwaying battell, which had nowe leſt thrée of their Falkons, wythdraweth the wounded into the middes of the battell, and with greate force beates backe the inſulting <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotes,</hi> and ſlaying <hi>Alexio Boſigno</hi> a noble <hi>Geeke</hi> their captain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Frenche power was deuided into three battailes: <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouille</hi> and <hi>De la Marche</hi> hauyng the leadyng of the wyngs, and <hi>Trivulzi</hi> of the middle battayle: and the <hi>Batallion</hi> of the Lance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenetz hadde gotten them within a ditche betweene the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes of the horſemenne, bycauſe theyr Trenche beeyng of a newe and wounderfull workemanſhippe inuented by <hi>Roberte de la March,</hi> for to encloſe them agaynſte the chaunce of battayle, coulde not bee pitched and ſette vp in that ſuddayne commyng of the ennimie.</p>
            <p>Vppon this Eſquadron of the <hi>Almaynes,</hi> the Switzers bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging about their battell towardes the right hande, courageouſly tourned them ſelues, for that they vnderſtoode the victorye woulde bee eaſely obtained, after they had once defeated the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt force of their enimies armye.</p>
            <p>The Frenche Captaynes ſeeyng this, incontinentely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the greate ordinaunce to bee ſhotte off vppon them: the rankes to bee broken thoroughe wyth greate ſlaughter, and anone after the menne of armes alſo vehemently charged them on the lefte ſyde. In this tumulte the <hi>Amans</hi> of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Zuche</hi> were ſlaine: yet the Souldiours nothyng appalled wyth their Captaines deathes, neyther with their owne perill, nor the horrible ſlaughter of their fellowes, gathering their ſtrength to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, do caſt them ſelues into a ring, and wyth greate valoure doe propell the horſmen: and ſtraightway, as they had before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, paſſing ouer the ditche, ſet vppon the <hi>Almaines.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon incontinently began a bloudye and cruell fight, yea and that without either wordes or noiſe on eyther ſide, ſauyng onlye an horrible claſhyng of armour and weapons, and the ſofte ſighes

            <p>Alſo in another quarter almoſte at the ſame inſtant, the third companye or battell of the Switzers, ſhewed themſelues at the fronte of the Frenchemen, which battell (whileſt the Frenchmen hadde in vayne ſhotte off their ordinance into the woodde that ſtoode béefore them, by reaſon the Switzers to deceiue the enni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had politikely lefte among the trees certayne vnprofitable drudges, to make a ſhewe of armed men) hadde crepte along by a ſyde way, by little and little ſtoupyng and traylyng theyr py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes after them.</p>
            <p>And nowe ſo greate was their contempt of the flying bullets and ſo terrible their chardge, that the Frenche and <hi>Nauarrine</hi> foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (their Captaine <hi>Beamont</hi> being ſlayne) and twoo bandes of <hi>Genoueſe</hi> and <hi>Salucians,</hi> were quickly defeated, and alſo their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce taken and tourned on the backs of them that fled. When the reſte of the horſemen ſawe the greate ordinaunce gotten by the enimie, in whome the Frenchemen hadde in all warres repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more truſte, than in theyr armes and proweſſe, that the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> were nowe almoſte quite deſtroyed, their tents taken, the enimie ouerthrowing all, &amp; now large lords of the field, betwene
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15177:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhame and feare they tourned their backes. When all men were thus diſmayed, the Captaines themſelues were fearleſſe enough (conſidering the fearefulneſſe of the ſtate) and went about to ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the rankes that were diſordered, and turned them ſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the diſſonant cries of their own fellowes, made them to abide and fighte, encouraged the petye Capitaines and enſigne bearers to put away feare, and ſo long to ſuſteine a fewe peſants of weary, vnarmed and nowe weakened wyth woundes, vntill the lighte armed had encloſed them. The Lanſquenetz beare the brunt of the battell, and the fight is repaired in all places. But the horſemen being nothing moued wyth the wordes of the encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and commaunding captaines, ſhamefullye flye: For the Switzers althoughe their Captaine <hi>Mottine</hi> were ſlaine by a péece of ordinaunce, yet hauing gotten the Campe, did al bloudy fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inuade the lefte ſide of the horſemen, and on the righte ſyde, and on the back a greater power with terrible pikes, did very ſharply vrge the affrighted and diſordered horſemen. There periſhed in repairing the fielde, <hi>Monfalcon</hi> Captaine of the Duke of <hi>Albanies</hi> companye of horſmen, and <hi>Coriolano Trivulzi,</hi> a yong Gentleman of ſingular hope. But the <hi>Almaines,</hi> who leeſing halfe their men and two enſignes and their Generall <hi>Floranges</hi> greeuouſly hurte, had foughte very conſtantly a long time: Nowe when they ſawe themſelues to bee forſaken by the horſemen, and the reſte of the footemen in all quarters to be defeated, and the great ordinaunce taken: thinking that flight was ſhamefull, and yet nothing ſafe, did ſet the points of their weapons vpright accordyng vnto their manner and yeelded themſelues, ſeeking mercye of the victor eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys. In this grieuous vproare <hi>Robert de la March</hi> Lorde of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> attached with impotent ſorow to ſee his two ſonnes the lords <hi>Floranges</hi> and <hi>Gemeſe</hi> encloſed by the enimye, and almoſte in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate daunger of life, burſt in euen into the midſt of his enimies battell wyth a troupe of horſemen, and toke them vppe lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead bodyes miſerably berayed and embrued wyth the bloude of their woundes, and being halfe dead, layde them ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwarte the neekes of two horſes, like vnto twoo cloke bagges: and thus wyth ſingular praiſe bothe of fatherly pitie and warlike
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15177:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>proweſſe, he caried them away, preſeruing their liues to purchaſe renowne in future and more fortunate fieldes. Thus the Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers fighting in thrée companyes or battells, within an houre and an halfe dyſpatched and finiſhed a famous battell, and a moſte weyghtye warre. Neyther yet althoughe the Switzers ſawe ſo many of their enimies lye ſlaine before their face canne they once to the ſpoyle, notwithſtanding that precious furniture of houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and al the baggage of the riche army did allure their minds: for they remembring their country diſcipline, which doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte them to take anye armed man priſoner in the battell, nor to purſue any that flieth: ſtoode ſtill a great part of the day, fearing leſt the French horſmen incited either through the policie of their Captaines, or theyr owne ſhame, would come backe againe, and appreſſe them while they were buſied in ſpoilyng the deade. But their enimies ranne awaye wyth ſuche feare and pertinacie: that <hi>Trivulzi</hi> galloping to &amp; fro all duſtie and hoarſe with crying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, was not able eyther by faire or foule ſpeache, or the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthoritie of Generall, to ſtay the enſignes or to retaine the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that caſting awaye their launces, gallopped awaye foremoſt. It is well knowen, that <hi>Grittie</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Prouiditor, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a companion of this vnluckye iourney ran awaye with them, oftentimes ſayde among this company of haſting horſmen: Yee olde horſemen that flyng awaye ſo faſte vppon the ſpurre to day, bee not the men of armes of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but thoſe noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>France,</hi> that vſed to cal them women runaways. Certes it neuer happened before, that Captains, (at all other times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible and fortunate,) being furniſhed wyth ſo great an army, were defeated by a fewe footemen, fortune nowe liſting to ſporte a little. It is reported that the French horſemen might haue bin all wholy deſtroyed in their flighte, if <hi>Maximilian Sforza</hi> had had but two hundreth men of armes, for not one of the French horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men caried launce beyonde <hi>Seſithes:</hi> (ſo greate was their heate to eſcape) yet a while after <hi>Siluio Sabello,</hi> and <hi>Corradino Cribelly,</hi> with certaine light horſmen, purſued them euen to the towne of <hi>Treca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> But the <hi>Contadmes</hi> or Peſantes running out of the fieldes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſame daye the Switzers gathering togither the ſlaine bodies of their countrymen, caried them on their ſhoulders into the Citie, that the laſte honoures myght iuſtly be done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that had ſingularly wel deſerued of the common wealth.</p>
            <p>There were ſlaine of them in this victory aboute a thouſande three hundreth, of whome they broughte into the Towne aboue ſeuen hundreth torne into péeces with the great ordinaunce, and almoſte as many were wounded. But on the Frenche part were ſlaine to the number of eight thouſande of all ſortes. Among the Captaines of the Switzers, the almoſte monſtrous valor of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> of <hi>Vnderwalde</hi> was ſpecially noted, who (by the credible report of many,) ſlewe twenty of his ennimies with his halberde, cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the iuſte rewardes of aſſured praiſe.

            <p>A ſquare plotte of fifty paces euerye waye, like vnto a ſmall Campe being meaſured out, foure ſtrong poſtes ſharped at the ende, were driuen into the grounde at euery angle one, ſtandyng aboue the grounde nauell highe: the ſides were defenced with leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer poſts or ſtakes, a certaine ſpace being lefte betweene poſt and poſt: betweene the poſtes went rayles, which they might take off and on, they being faſtened togither with yron bookes or claſpes. The <hi>Almaines</hi> ſtoode within this munition, which was defenced rounde about wyth almoſte an hundreth Harquebuzers a crocke.

            <p>But this engine inuented by a warlike witte, and brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the <hi>Alpes</hi> with ſo greate labour and charges, as it did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delight the eyes of the beholders both for the noueltie of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion and the hope of victory: ſo Fortune after hir wonted guiſe ſcorning ſuch ſubtill inuentions, tooke ſucceſſe quite away from reaſon, and the woorke, when it ſhoulde haue taken moſte ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte.

            <p>Then hadde he ſo greate ſtore of greate and ſmall artillerye, as would well ſuffiſe two greate armyes, and the wagons and carts that caried boullets, gunpowder, pikeaxes, crowes of yron, and

            <p>There alſo followed for deſire of pillage a ſtrong regiment of voluntarie footemen, vnder certaine enſignes and Captaines, and with them thrée thouſande Pioners. With this army, whych for number and furniture, paſſed all that anye man had ſéene in our dayes: <hi>Francis</hi> paſſed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and encamped betwene the town of <hi>Marignano,</hi> and the citie of <hi>Milan,</hi> both aſwell to interclude the armies of the Pope, and the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> from the Switzers, who were come to <hi>Milan</hi> to defende the Duke, and to make <hi>Liuiano</hi> the Generall of the <hi>Venetians</hi> his confederate, more ſtrong by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquitie and neareneſſe of his Campe, as alſo to defende hym from the <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> that were very neare him.</p>

            <p>There manye were of the opinion, that the waye to obtayne the victorye, was in no wiſe to ioyne in battell with the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men before they hadde vnited theyr power wyth the Popes and <hi>Spaniſhe</hi> armyes, (the one whereof) conſiſted of fourtéene bandes of <hi>Italian</hi> footemen, and thrée thouſande horſemen: the other of eight hundreth men of armes, and a thouſande light horſemen, beſides a regiment of olde <hi>Spaniſhe</hi> footemen: whereof euery ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour beyng as famous for hys valiaunt actes, as riche by reaſon of greate ſpoiles, didde matche bothe petye Capitaines, yea and Capitaines in chiefe, not onely in approued ſtouteneſſe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in brauery of armoure: or at the leaſte before they had brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght the Frenche Kyng, who truſted muche in hys munitions, thoroughe ſome neceſſitye into a more indifferent place.

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:15177:54"/>ſtanding in the way vnto <hi>Pauia:</hi> for if the Frenche Kyng woulde for all this iourney of the Switzers, perſiſte ſtill in hys ſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenced lodging, that then they might eaſely go from <hi>Binaſco</hi> by the towne of <hi>Sanangelo,</hi> and through a country abounding in all kinde of victuals, vnto the riuer of <hi>Po,</hi> wherby the bridges which were ready built, the armies of the confederats might ioyne with them: but if the Frenche King fearing leaſt he ſhoulde bée ſtopped both from the Citie of <hi>Paura,</hi> and alſo from the ſtone bridge ouer the riuer of <hi>Teſino,</hi> (where hée had lefte a ſmall garriſon) wold march vnto <hi>Pauia:</hi> that then eyther they myght fight wyth hym wyth more equall condition, or elſe incontinently tourne on the lefte hande vnto <hi>Lody:</hi> and there ſending for, and receyuing into theyr Campe, the powers of the <hi>Spaniſhe</hi> King, and the Pope, they ſhold ſtraight way tourne <hi>Liuiano</hi> from his purpoſed forney, and daſhe the paſſyng greate hope of victory, that the Frenchemen had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued by their former fortunate ſucceſſes. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things were declared, and alſo plotfes and chartes were ſhewed, wherin were deſcribed the wayes and ſite of the regions, that the rude witted men might more certainly vnderſtande and knowe thoſe things which were counſelled, then diuers Captaines (who indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced eyther by their olde iudgement, or elſe by French golde, lately giuen by <hi>Francis</hi> had accepted conditions of peace wyth hym, at a village called <hi>Galarato</hi>) by their diſſentyng &amp; enterlaſing of vaine difficulties, and affyrming that thoſe things were to be ſurueyed wyth great conſideration and maturity, cleane ouerturned al this meane and way of wholſome and good counſell. Wherefore leaſte the harts of thoſe that were faithfull might languiſh by tariance, and the good willes of the vncertayne multitude be tourned into perfidiouſneſſe: the Cardinall thought it beſte to bring them by all ſleightes to fight with the Frenchmen out of hande, thinking thereby eyther to winne a notable victory, or if the Switzers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the ouerthrowe by vnfortunate fight, to ſome vnappeſible enimitie and immortall hatred betwéene the Frenche nation, and the Switzers. Hauing therefore communicated his counſell and purpoſe with the enſigne bearers, and the moſt faithful chief men of the Cantons: hée ſecretely admoniſhed <hi>Mutio Colonna</hi> (a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:15177:54"/>of the Popes horſemen) that of a ſette matche, when he had receyued the ſignall, hée ſhoulde cauſe an alarme to be cried, and as thoughe the Frenchemen approched vnto the ſuburbs wyth a great power, ſhould iſſue out with the horſemen, and with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaiting as greate fear &amp; perill as he could poſſibly, ſhuld craue aide of the Switzers. He alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the formoſt bands of the Switzers to do the ſame: who being of great renoume of valor, and hatred towardes the Frenchemen, had ſtill requeſted at the beginning of all wars, to haue the places next vnto the enimies. And ſo accordingly the Souldiours had no ſooner dined, and were gone to take their noone nappe, but the trumpets and drummes ſodainly ſounded at the gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> and anone the rumour of the comming of the Frenchemen waxing hotte, all the bands one after another, when the foremoſte tolde them, that followed, the cauſe of the alarme, made themſelues ready, and with incredible feruency of fight, iſſued out at the gate: whome alſo the miſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted regiment folowing with aduanced enſignes, haſted on heaps vnto the gate, leaſt they ſhould ſéeme in that tumult, whiche ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteyned vnto the publike ſafety and eſtimation, eyther to haue forſaken thoſe that were before, or to be of another opinion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the cauſe of the warres.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall being notorious for his hatte and ſcarlet robe, roade vpon a greate horſe before the marching rankes, wyth hys croſſe borne before hym, and ſtill as he came vnto the enſigne bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, the pety Captaines or any Souldiours of marke, for nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble factes, he would encourage and inkindle them to make ſpéede, ſaying that God and the holy Saintes, did promiſe them the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of that daye, in the which they ſhoulde not only by valiaunt fight deſtroye all the whole nobility of <hi>France,</hi> brought vnder the conducte of a Princoxe King betwene two armies of his enimies, but alſo breaking the power of the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Genoueſe</hi> by theyr fortitude and felicitie, giue lawes and conditions vnto all <hi>Italy:</hi> nor that the hyred <hi>Almaines,</hi> in whom conſiſted the Kings chiefe ſtrength (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet they had often foyled in fight) were ſo eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperor or were of ſo prodigall prowes, that a man might thinke they would for the Frenchmens ſakes, who indéede
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15177:55"/>were their vtter enimies, fight againſt the honour of al <hi>Germany:</hi> neither yet they ſhould thinke that the <hi>Gaſcoignes,</hi> very runaways, or thoſe horſemen that braued it in their ſilkes and chaynes of golde, who had vſed to repoſe a little more ſafetie in their horſes and ſpurres, than in their ſwordes, ſtrengthe, and ſtomackes, would fight either more ſtoutly or conſtantly, than they had done before. But that labour and perill whiche was lefte, was to bee vndertaken with a noble hearte in winning the ordinance of the enimies. Where if any of them were ſlaine, they might moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beleue, that their ſoules being clenſed from all ſpottes of ſinne by hym, with the Popes authoritie, woulde forthwith flye into heauen, leauing behinde on the earthe a notable memorye of their ſingular valiancy. As the Cardinall ridde to the foremoſte ranks, euery where ſtil pronouncing theſe ſpeches: ther folowed hym <hi>Galeaze Viſconti, Iohn Gonzaga, Cambero</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> the Popes Legates, and diuers horſemen of thoſe families, that of auntient good will fauoured the name of <hi>Sforza,</hi> and had ioyned themſelues with the Switzers, when they iſſued out. And alſo certayne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med bands of the commons, and cutters, intermedled themſelues of theyr owne accorde with the company paſſyng by.</p>
            <p>They had ſcarcely marched thrée miles from <hi>Milan,</hi> neyther was the French Campe aboue thirty furlongs from them, when they began to ſhoot off their great ordinance, which was ten fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons: whych thing brought great hofulneſſe &amp; admiration vnto the <hi>Italian</hi> horſemen: for <hi>Mutius</hi> riding with changed cheare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Capitaines of the firſt company, began to aſke them what madneſſe had moued men ſkilfull in martiall matters, and the maiſters of that diſcipline, to ſtriue with the vnſeaſonable thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of theyr ordynaunce, to rouſe the enimye whome they had thought beſt to inuade being vnprepared and looking for nothing leſſe than battell. Vnto whom it was couragiouſly aunſwered by the foremoſte rankes, that they ſhoulde fight well enough accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſcipline of warre, euen with the armed and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded enimy, if their miſtruſted fellowes, and the enſignes of al the <hi>Cantons</hi> with one counſell and intent deſcended into the field with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:15177:55"/>them: which thing they hoped might be brought to paſſe, if that through that faining of more certaine ſignes, that the battell was begun, had come vnto the eares of their folowing fellows, whoſe valor vanquiſhed by infamous hire and mony, if that there were no ſhame at all in them of the publike dignitie, yet at the leaſte the grones of their kinſfolke falling down dead before their eyes, the religion of a ſouldiors othe, and the fear of iudgement, which wold anone after be giuen at home againſt the forſakers of their fellowes, they thought woulde be able to ſtirre vp and inflame them: for ſo greate truſte of valor was in their proude heartes, that they deſpiſed with very greate contempt the moſte mightye and ſtrong power of the enimies, neyther did they thinke that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtore and multitude of greate ordinance, or any munitions of place would ſtay their force from breaking into their Campe, by bearing them down and vanquiſhing. Aboue al other, there were thrée valiaunt fellowes, but men of barbarous proweſſe, called <hi>Pelegrine Landaberg, Centy Amerer,</hi> and <hi>Rafe Long,</hi> that led the thrée voluntary bandes of moſte valiaunt Souldiours that were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the front.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as euer theſe menne were come within the ſyghte of their ennimyes, they incontinentely burned oute wyth ſo greate heate of fight, that they coulde not be helde backe by the reſt of the Captaines, who with better counſell had commaunded the enſignes to ſtaye, and to take a place to lodge in, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the Souldiours, who were weary of their iourney, but that they woulde néedes haſte towardes the ennimyes wyth ſpéedye pace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Burben</hi> and <hi>Trivulzi</hi> were encamped at Sainte <hi>Iulians</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in a ſmall village, and wiſely lodged at the lefte ſide of the high waye, whyche was defenced on all partes wyth ſtiepe and déepe ditches, and after the manner of the Countreys, wyth hyghe bankes, nexte vnto them the Kyng hym ſelfe, and behynde hym the Duke of <hi>Alaunſon,</hi> (vnto whome by right of bloude the kyngdome of <hi>France</hi> dydde appertayne, if that <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> dyed wythout heyre male,) hadde placed the middle battell
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15177:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>and rerewarde, one being ſeuered from the other. by a ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. They being thus lodged in thrée parts, that the thrée great armies, might the more commodiouſly and ſpéedily be an aide one vnto another, when chaunce did require, were encloſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a large and very well defenced place: for rounde aboute were many ditches made by the huſbandmen, to water their lands, and <hi>Nauarro</hi> had alſo added new munitions in commodious places, where it was thought good and néedefull, and alſo had ſet vppe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enimy, mighty targets faſtened in the grounde, and cloſed togyther with greate ropes, that the <hi>Gaſcoignes</hi> beyng de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and couered by them, might ſhoote at the enimy more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ceratinly. This forme of the Campe, and the nature of the place had <hi>Mutius</hi> and certaine of the Capitaynes of the Switzers riding vnto the higher part of the banke, for to ſuruey the camp, incontinently marked, and then had alſo noted, that on the right hande there was a commodious place lefte for them to lodge in, where was a prety low plaine, encloſed almoſt on two ſides with a ſmall riuer that ranne downe vnto corne milles. They began to counſell the Switzers to encampe in that place, and their bodyes being refreſhed wyth reſt and meate, to thinke nothing raſhly of fight: they alſo tolde them, that as victory procéedeth from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and good aduiſe, ſo vaine and ſorowfull attemptes from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſed hardineſſe: and that thoſe men do oftner féele the aduerſe euentes of fight, that truſte to ouercome their enimyes by deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſſe and feaſe, than thoſe that ſéek victory by profitable tari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and reaſon. Moreouer they ſayde, that the enimy was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked againſte all aboadement, bycauſe by an olde obſeruation of that nation, that day of the wéeke was all the yeare after vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, vpon the which Childermaſſe day had fallen.</p>
            <p>This was the thirtéenth of September. But when that fury and fatall madneſſe (the which had neuer hapned before vnto the Switzers in the warres) had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſouldiors, and authority from the captaines: the buſier ſort ranne foorth and attached a very cruell fight with the <hi>Gaſcoignes</hi> and <hi>Almaines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trivulzi</hi> and <hi>Burben,</hi> hauyng intelligence long beefore, of the comming of the enimies, had ſette their men in array of battell,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15177:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>and placed their ordinance in a fitte place, but nowe being doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe preſſed, did ſette on fire all the houſes of the village, both to ſtaye the feaſe of the enimies by the fire, and alſo to bereaue them of the vſe and munition of the houſes, and then reduced their men into a larger place. Before the Frenche ordinaunce, was there a mighty ditche, which muſt be paſſed ouer with extreame peril of deſperateneſſe, the whiche ditche was kepte by <hi>Nauarro</hi> his bands, and the Launſquenetz men of paſſyng valour, wyth their thicke rankes. This ditche a bande or ring of very deſperate yongmen, doubted not to paſſe with more aſſured death than victorye.</p>
            <p>They were very choſen felows taken out of al the <hi>Cantons,</hi> men in the prime of youth, and of ſingular forwardeneſſe: who by a very auntient order of that Countrey, that by dooyng ſome déede of paſſyng proweſſe, they may obtaine rare honour of warrefare before they be growen in yeares, doe of themſelues requeſte all perillous and harde péeces of ſeruice, and often vſe wyth deadlye praiſe to runne vnto propoſed death. Theſe men do they call of their immoderate fortitude, and ſtoutneſſe, the deſperats, forlorne hopen, and the frenchmen <hi>Enfans perdus:</hi> and it is lawfull for them by the prerogatiue of their proweſſe, to beare an enſigne, to haue conducte, and double wages all their life long. Neyther are the forlorne knowen from the reſt by anye other marke and cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, than the plumes of white feathers, the which after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Captaines, they doe tourne behinde, waueryng ouer theyr ſhoulder with a braue kynde of riot. They wyth noble cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ranne full vppon the ordinaunce, and after that they hadde valiauntly and long fought with greate loſſe in the place of great diſaduauntage, at length, when that they woulde for no incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie giue ouer, they driuing the <hi>Almaines</hi> out of the place, and beating backe <hi>Nauarro</hi> hys bandes, came ouer the heapes of the dying vnto their ordinance. The which (in number ſeuen péeces) being taken, they relying themſelues agayne, vrged their ſhrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king enimyes, and diſordered all the whole foreward.</p>
            <p>In this greate daunger <hi>Trivulzi</hi> and <hi>Burbon</hi> flue hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to repaire the diſtreſſed battell, to the vttermoſt that they could do by ſtrength, or prouide by counſell, ſending in the horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:15177:57"/>in diuers places.</p>
            <p>Neyther fayled <hi>Nauarro</hi> vnto his Souldiours, by chydyng ſome, and aſking other, whether that they hadde come from the fartheſt parte of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and the Mountaines <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> onely for to turne their backes, and moſte ſhamefully to flye out of the fielde almoſte before they had ſéene their enimies, that they ſhould plucke vp their heartes, and make ready their harquebuſſes, and bowes, and abide ſo long, vntil that their ſides were garded with freſhe ſuccour of horſemen, and thinke that they ought to wipe out, by fighting that day valiantly, the note of cowardiſe, or of ill lucke, that they had gotten at <hi>Rauenna</hi> by fighting ill. So at one time, a mighty troupe of horſemen breaking vppon them, and the <hi>Gaſcoignes</hi> being ſtayed by adhortation and ſhamefaſteneſſe, and the Lanſquenetz kéeping their place for anger and ſhame, a cruel and variable fighte is renewed: bothe ſydes are inuaded wyth the horrible noiſe of the ordinaunce and weapons, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes are torne into péeces: Anone <hi>Cenry</hi> and <hi>Pelegrine</hi> are ſlayne fighting couragiouſly, and <hi>Pure</hi> the Captaine of the Pretorian or guarde bande, and with him foure enſigne bearers are ſlaine by a greate culuering ſhotte from the ſide. Neither did the Switzers, (who fetching a longer compaſſe aboute had come vnto the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) faile vnto the their diſtreſſed fellowes, for they gathering thrée bandes togyther into one, came in twoo companyes wyth freſhe ſtrength and courage, and encountering wyth the footemen on the lefte hande, ſlue <hi>Sciatalarde,</hi> a Captaine of the <hi>Gaſcoignes</hi> of renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med name: and <hi>Lewes</hi> and <hi>George</hi> Earles of <hi>Hellempurg,</hi> noble men of <hi>Germanye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in another parte, they looſing a little their ranckes, did receyue in among them the charging horſemenne, where they fought long with variable and doubtfull fortune: for althoughe the men of armes cruelly treading to death the diſperſed and the ouerthrowen, did with the force and feaſe of their horſes breake throughe with ſlaughter the flight and thinne ſmall bandes, yet when they met with the thicke rankes, they were eyther broched with their long pikes, or elſe their horſes being ſlain vnder them, periſhed thorough the waighte of their armour. There were
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:15177:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſlayne in that place very valiantly fighting theſe Capitaines of companies of horſmen, the Erle of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> the Lord <hi>Imbercourt,</hi> a renoumed man for his ſingular proweſſe and long ſeruice in the warres, the Lorde <hi>Buſſy de Ambois,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Burbon:</hi> and <hi>Burbon</hi> himſelf was in the like danger of life, as he himſelfe ſaid, being among the thickeſt of that bloudye broyle. But afterward I heard the contrary of the kyng hymſelf, who affyrmed, naming witneſſes, that <hi>Burbon</hi> durſte not ſuccour his encloſed brother, and retired vntouched out of the ſight of the enimies vnto the middle battell. Alſo whileſt that <hi>Trivulzi</hi> ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured in vaine to ſuccour his encloſed and dying enſignebearer he being toſſed among the pikes and halberdes of hys enimies, and his horſe wounded, and the creſte ſtroken off from his helmet, gotte hymſelfe out of thys daunger by the reſcous of hys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of horſemen.</p>
            <p>And nowe was the battayle hardely ſuſteyned in moſte places, and the Switzers, for that they had paſſed ouer the very yll ditche, had with greate valor wonne the ordinance, and defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the footemen, and diſordering the horſemen, had wonne the place where their enimies had ſtoode, ſéemed to haue the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the battell: when the King aduauncing forward wyth him the middle battell, and commaunding <hi>Alencon</hi> to folow him with the rereward with equall pace, and many péeces of ordinance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſtowed by the Captaines in certaine places by whom the Eſquadrons of the Switzers might bée annoyed on the ſydes, came in very good time wyth the blacke regiment, and a mightye number of horſemen, hée couragiouſly profeſſing bothe to hys owne Souldiours, and alſo vnto hys enimyes, by hys coate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Skye colour, poudered wyth Lillies of golde, that hée was the King, was conuerſaunt in the fore front, valiauntly laide on the enimye, and perillouſlye galloppyng hys horſe hyther and thither, encountred the hoteſt of the enimies, &amp; finally infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his ſouldiors not only wyth words &amp; adhortations, but alſo with ſingular example of true prowes: for the Switzers did preſſe on ſo feruently, and ſtoode to it ſo ſternely and ſtoutly, yea and ſo great was the valor and courage, yea of them that were wounded
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15177:58"/>and were dying, that the Kyng in that iniquitie of fight muſte néedes forget his maieſtye, contemne his life, and repaire his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined ſtate rather by valiant hand and ſtrength, than by ſleight, counſell or aduice. The horſemen alſo who had by running away at <hi>Nouarra</hi> and <hi>Turwin,</hi> loſte the olde opinion of their proweſſe, did now leaſt that if they ſhould againe giue place, be marked for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after with euerlaſting ignomy: contend to ſatiſfy the Kyng (who fought valiauntly in the ſight of them all) eyther by hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable death, or elſe with noble victory. There were ſlaine in this encounter the Prince of <hi>Talemonde,</hi> ſonne vnto <hi>Seigneur Tremouiile,</hi> and <hi>Seigneur de Roy,</hi> a man of greate nobilitie in <hi>Picardie,</hi> and <hi>Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur Vantell,</hi> who bare the extraordinary ſtanderde of the Kyngs troupe, and many moe of the valianteſt horſemen, and <hi>Mounſieur de Moy</hi> that bare the enſigne of a very noble company of horſmen, bycauſe they beyng empeached and entangled wyth the ditches and vines, could not get out and orderly range their bands. But of the Switzers there was ſlaine <hi>Rafe Long,</hi> that greate ſtirrer vp of the multitude, and alſo <hi>Flech,</hi> a man more renoumed for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liauncye, than his ſtocke, and <hi>VVolter Offy,</hi> who for his ſingular prudence, &amp; mighty ſtrength (which are not lightly blended togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in men of that nation) had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great opinion of proweſſe in al warres, &amp; eſpecially at the battell of <hi>Nouara.</hi> They fought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſeauen houres without ceaſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when the ſunne had failed them in the mids of the heate of the battell, the Moone that then ſhined bright, kepte both armies in armes. And the fighte was horrible and very bloudy, as long as there was any light at all. But anone when the Moone was hidden wyth the cloudes, althoughe they being wearied with toile and woundes, and their weapons blunted, ſought place for reſte, yet in the meane tyme through mutuall error both friends and foes were ſlaine by blind and frantike blowes. For when the <hi>Almaines</hi> not beyng muche vnlike vnto the Switzers, neyther in tongue nor habite, were blended togither with the Switzers in dyuers places, at length the watcheworde bewrayed them, and then foule ſlaughter was committed in the darke. Neyther ceaſſed the ordinance all night: but as they were ſhotte off without any certaine markes, ſo did
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:15177:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>they cauſe more terror than flaughter. The Cardinall, who had not this daye failed vnto his Countrymen in hope, care and toile, did by miſtaking the place, lighte among the <hi>Almaines,</hi> but got himſelfe out of the daunger by counterfaiting their tongue by a rougher voice, and paſſying the ditche returned vnto the burnyng houſes of the village, whether <hi>Roſty</hi> and <hi>Anglarde,</hi> being inuited with the ſhining of the fire, and many other of the Captaines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting, as it were vnto the Generalls tent, had cauſed the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty horne of a wilde <hi>Vri,</hi> (the which being deliuered by hand from their anceſters, is kept with great care and religion at <hi>Vri,</hi> the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of the libertye of the Switzers) to be ſounded, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed and wandering Souldiours might be called vnto the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. This no doubte ſaued many, that were intermedled in diuers places among their enimies, bycauſe they coulde haue no certaine recourſe vnto their fellowes, the likeneſſe of the ſounds of the drummes confounding their eares. Both armies by reaſon of mutuall feare paſſed the whole night without ſléepe, yet were more readye in hearte, than in ſtrength for to fight againe: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the valiant, &amp; alſo the cowardes were both tyred with the long toile of fight, yet with dyuers habites of heart they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited eyther with deſire of fight, victory, or feare of death. The Cardinall, and the reſt of the Captaines, althoughe that the firſte opinion ſéemed greately to haue deceyued them, for that they had not (as they hadde hoped) vanquiſhed at the firſte charge their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, yea being diſordered with great ſlaughter, and loſt wyth almoſtle vaine attempt the ſtouteſt of their men: yet forſake not themſelues and call many into counſell, and when that it pleaſeth them all to expecte the light, and to fight againe, they doe decrée that certaine be ſent to <hi>Milan,</hi> to requeſte all kinde of helpe, for that they had come foorth vnprouided of all things. <hi>Iohn Gonzaga</hi> is ſent to fill wyth newe hope <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and the Citizens of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> who were hofull of the euent of the battell, and to ſende from the Citie out of hand bread and meate ready dreſſed, and many veſſels of wine for the ſouldiours that fainted for wearineſſe and thirſte, and to conuey vnto the Campe greate ordinance, ſhotte and pouder with all poſſible ſpéede. But when the Counſell was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:15177:59"/>broken vppe, the Capitaines and enſigne bearers ſpake dyuerſly among the Souldiours, according as euery man thought of the Cardinall and of the euent of the battell. Some beyng deſirous of honour and victory, made light of the greate loſſe that they had in déede, and did extoll and augment with falſe tales, the valiant actes of their fellowes, and the ſlaughter of the Frenchmen.</p>
            <p>Contrariwiſe, thoſe of the aduerſe faction, that they might ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilye prouide for their owne ſafety, and alſo augment the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of dignitie, and lyfe in the Cardinall, who was enuironed with extreame difficulties, diſbended, and returned to <hi>Milan.</hi> Alſo the Popes horſemen, who for their ſmall number had ſerued to no greate vſe, did for a greate parte of them, either for feare or deſpaire forſake their captaines, and returne into the Citie. But although the king were deliuered and ridde of the greateſt feare, and mightieſt daunger, and ſéemed to haue nobly ſuſteined men of ſo greate valor, yet being hofull for the feare that remayned, and as it were the laſte care, exſpected the ende of the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome night, and vncertaine fortune. Neyther did he giue greater reſte vnto his bodye, whiche was wearyed with the weight of his armour, and was ſcortched for thirſte and continuall toile, than pulling vppe his beauer to take breath, leane a little while vppon a greate péece of ordinance, whileſt that his horſe was chaunged. And then incontinently tourning to the charges of a chieftaine, ſent vnto <hi>Liuiano</hi> to come vnto hym wyth his armye, and anone drewe in and made his Campe leſſe. After that the deuiſe hadde béene liked of the Captaynes, to whome he had imparted it, and bycauſe that the enimy profeſſed the place where his fore warde had ſtoode, he placed within a better defenced plot aboue ſixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande <hi>Almaines</hi> at the banke of the ditche, and commaunded them to guard the ordinance, which he had commodiouſly planted there in greate abundaunce. And in another quarter he ioyned a great number of horſemen with himſelfe, and willed <hi>Burbon,</hi> and <hi>Alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen,</hi> to admoue the firſte and thirde battells vnto his ſide wyth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall order and front: ſo that hée ſtanding full butte againſt the enimy, did, as the place required, ſtand in ſtéede of the fore warde, and vſed the two other battells placed on his lefte and right ſides as it were for wings. Neyther farre from that place had <hi>Nauarro,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:15177:59"/>and a greate multitude of <hi>Almaines</hi> encamped, pitching downe their enſignes in the grounde, bycauſe when the battell was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by the going downe of the Moone, they coulde learne nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the forme of the Campe, nor the kings counſell and purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The King, that hée might viewe with his owne eyes howe the ditches ſtoode, and how broade the fielde that laye betwéene them, and the highe waye was, roade foorth with a few horſemen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſight of the enimy, and anone the darke vaniſhing by little and little into the dawning, the King went to encourage the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> whome being erected by greate promiſes, he adhorted to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the battell by fighting a little while, and to take the rewards of victory alredy gotten. He alſo full of aſſured hope, and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſneſſe, vehementely enkindeled them by rehearſing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries and diſcomfitures, that the Switzers had don and giuen the <hi>Almaines,</hi> rather through the benefit of fortune, and the greate aduantages of times and places, than by true proweſſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhoulde perſuade themſelues that this was the proper and ready occaſion to reuenge the Maſſacre of their kinſfolks, and fellowe Souldiours, and alſo the meane for to ſhewe by valiaunt actes, that as the <hi>Almaines</hi> did excell them in nobilitie, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: ſo neyther woulde they graunt vnto theſe clownes the martiall glory for valor and ſkil in armes. And alſo vſing the like ſpéeche he adhorted the French horſemen, not to degenerate from their forefathers, who had in former ages excelled all nations for ſeruice on horſbacke. Neyther were the batells ranged among the Switzers with leſſe hope &amp; courage, although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt parte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſouldiors, as they had with diuers chaunces lodged in ſundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ye &amp; within the munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimy, being refreſhed with no ſuccour of meate did hardly with fierce hartes ſuſteine their fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting limmes.

And alſo moſt of them when their breakefaſte was offered vnto them anone after the breake of the day, being called to the battell by the noiſe of the drummes, and the roaring of the ordinance, left their meate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired before, and alſo néedefull to repaire their ſtrength.</p>

            <p>At the beginning dyuers Capitaynes aſſembled togyther, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom was <hi>Haiſler</hi> &amp; <hi>Focte</hi> a famous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the honor of his age, and the cogniſaunces of his office, and <hi>Chezze Amman,</hi> who had ſerued in the fieldes aboue forty yeares pety.

Theſe men whether adduced by conſideration of the greate loſſe that they had receyued, or hauing intelligence of the departure of diuers of their fellows, and alſo now ſéeing through the benefit of the light, the greate diſaduauntage of the places, iudged it to be beſte to abſtaine from battell, thinking that they had gotten eſtimation ynoughe by yeſterdayes encounter for to breake the hauty heartes of the Frenchemen. But after they had gone aboute in vaine to ſtay, by diſſuading praiers the enſignes, which were now aduanced foreward, and to retein them by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt them in the way they ſhould goe: they alſo yéelded vnto the fate and wilfulneſſe of the ſouldiours.

The formoſt and greateſt battallion, wherein was placed the enſigne of the <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Zurich</hi> (the whyche is of higheſt dignitie among the Switzers) haſted directly agaynſte the Kings battel, the which we told you ſtood in the mids.

But vnto an other multitude of their fellowes, who were encamped in a fielde on the lefte hande, on this ſide the high way, they appointed no

Yet that company of Switzers bring more terrified by hys comming, than hys po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, for that they thought all the whole power of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> (who were indeede neare) were already come, beganne to prouide for their ſafety; for ſome of them being quite ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with werineſſe, woundes, thirſte, and ſweate, gotte them into the Gardens that neare adioyned: where a greate parte of them were ſlayne, when that the horſmen were ſent ofter them, yea from the kings battell: other retiring into the nexte village, after they had long time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelues at the gate, &amp; walls, vnder the conduct of <hi>Tuler Cefuſe,</hi> a very valiant captain, at the laſt being won and vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the ordinance and fire, moſt cruelly periſhed: but other being deſperſed, and fleing backe vnto the greateſt companye or battell of their fellows, the horſemen chaſing them in thoſe very large and open fieldes, had ben wholy deſtroyed, if that by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and valor of certayne olde ſouldiors (who in that frowning of fortune being mindefull of diſcipline, neuer failed vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and their fellowes) they had not retired vnto their fellows that were on this ſide the ditches and high way, in a thicke Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quadron. Almoſte at the very ſame time the thirde battell of the Switzers, the which we ſhewed you had ſtoode ouer right againſt <hi>Trivulzo</hi> and <hi>Burbon,</hi> eyther bycauſe they ſawe the iniquitie and diſaduauntage of the battell, or elſe were adduced by deteſtable counſell, for that they had rather ſatiſfy their faction and hatred, than publike neceſſity in being beholders of the ſlaughter and proweſſe of othermen, beganne to retire wyth their enſignes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <hi>Milan,</hi> neyther woulde they as men thoroughly attached with feare once come into the battell to fight, the whych yet they were almoſte forced to do: ſeing that they had all the lyght horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in ſight, &amp; were often ſhot at with the great ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: which beyng politikely hidden behinde the horſemen, were at the laſte when the troupes had opened at the ſounde of the trumpet, often ſhotte off in the voide ſpaces. Therefore when the reſte of the Switzers (whome wee lefte fyghtyng at the Kyngs battell)
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:15177:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>inflamed with fury and wrath, kepte their grounde rather by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of hearte, than ſtrength, and ſawe other freſhe regimentes of Launſquenetz to whom the light hadde not yet come, ready to come vppon them: they deſpairing of the victory, ſoun<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treite, for a little before they had receyued a greate detriment at the ditch: being maruellouſly endomaged from the higher ground by an innumerable multitude of arrowes, ſhotte by the <hi>Gaſcoignes</hi> Arcubaliſters, who being placed harde by the harquebuſters, that the one might haue time to chardge their harquebuſſes, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bende their croſſe bowes, did ſo ſhoot off one after another by hundrethes, with mutuall running backe, that the battell of the Switzers being ouerwhelmed with the continuall haile of the ſhotte, were without reuenge beaten down, they in vaine ſéeking ſuccour of proweſſe and valor. The battell being thus broken off, when that <hi>Rosty, Ronne, Anglarde,</hi> and the other Capitaynes coulde not ſuccour ſo greate and ſo drſordered a multitude, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhment, and commaunding them what they ſhould doe, nor eaſily doe the dueties of captains, the ſouldiors themſelues, yea although they were quite ſpoyled by ſo many incommodities, did in that iniquitie of things preſcribe vnto themſelues wyth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous conſtancie and ſingular ſkill, what was to bée done, that they might not ſéeme to flie. For hauing a care of the wounded, two ſouldiours did with ſingular pittie cary on their armes and ſhoulders one man weakened with woundes, and bringing backe euery one of the péeces of ordinance that they had brought from <hi>Milan,</hi> ſtrengthned the hyndermoſt taile with a guarde of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher Souldiours. But they marched with ſo ſtaied a part, that their departure ſéemed to haue no ſimilitude of flight: neyther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede coulde they be eaſely inuaded, bicauſe they were defenced on both ſides of the highe way wyth very déepe and continuall dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The Frenchmen, who had ſtoode armed in the battell twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty houres togither, and the moſte part of the time with doubtfull victory, and their limmes nowe ſlowed with ſweate, and theyr horſes fainted for wearineſſe, and had almoſte loſte the ſenſe of their eyes and eares with the thicke miſte of the raiſed duſte, and the inceſſant and horrible thundering of the ordinance, made an

The Switzers being very courteouſly and liberally recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and entertained in their olde lodgings at <hi>Milan,</hi> did put in the publicke hoſpitalles thoſe that were greuouſly wounded, and then gaue the reſte of the daye and the night folowing to recreate their bodies. The nexte daye they filled the broade ſtreate that lyeth before the Caſtell, with ſo greate a number, that by the eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all men, they ſéemed to haue riceyued almoſte no loſſe at all. There they holding a counſell, requeſted thrée moneths pay, and vnleſſe that it were preſently payed, they ſaid they wold go home. But when <hi>Maximilian</hi> could not perfourme it, bycauſe he hadde not ſo muche ready money, they incontinently aduaunced theyr enſignes at the gate that leadeth to <hi>Como,</hi> and went home. When a viewe was taken of them that were ſlaine, the Frenchmen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that of the fiue and twenty thouſande Switzers that had come foorth into the fielde, ſcarce the one halfe of them returned, and that of their men there were not aboue thrée thouſand ſlaine.

            <head>¶ Three battayles fought betweene <hi>Selym</hi> the great Turke, and Tomumbey the Sultan of Egypt, in the yeares. 1516. and. 17. Out of Iouius.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that <hi>Selym</hi> had intelligence that <hi>Synambaſſa</hi> had taken <hi>Gaza,</hi> and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited <hi>Gazelles,</hi> and alſo hée himſelfe had receyued a freſhe ſupplye of ſouldiours by ſea from <hi>Constanethople:</hi> he marched with his whole armye vnto <hi>Gaza,</hi> and from thence within eighte dayes came neare vnto the chiefe ſeate of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, called <hi>Caier, Synambaſſa</hi> always go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a days iorney before hym. Six myles from the Citie, is there a Village called <hi>Rhodania,</hi> into the which place <hi>Temumbey</hi> the new <hi>Sultan,</hi> had brought al his olde and newe prouiſion and furniture of great ordinance, and had made ditches croſſe ouer al the plain fielde, and the high waye, the which ditches he had couered ouer with ſmall ſtickes and earth layd vpon them: and he himſelf had ſtoode in an oportune place with the <hi>Mamaluches,</hi> who were about xij. thouſand, &amp; a great number of <hi>Arabian</hi> horſmen, for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that when the hoſte of the <hi>Turkes</hi> did beginne to approche, they might be beaten downe by the vnthought of ordinance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they coulde come to reache the Egyptians with theyr Harquebuſſes, and then he hymſelfe being ſpread rounde about them, woulde incontinently fyght with them being diſordered and fallen into the ambuſhe.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were ſo cunningly and prudently deuiſed, &amp; alſo perfected in ſo good time, that no man in the armie did thynk that the victorie of that day was any thing to be doubted of. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a gret calamitie hanged ouer the <hi>Turkes,</hi> if that Fortune, who as ſhe always fauored <hi>Selym,</hi> ſo ſhe enimy like, and ſharply perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <hi>Tomumbey,</hi> had not defeated the painefull endeuors of the <hi>Mamaluches,</hi> through the perfidiouſneſſe of a fewe perſons.</p>
            <p>There were in the <hi>Sultans</hi> armie foure <hi>Mamaluches, Albanoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> borne, who did greatly ſtomack it, that <hi>Tomumbey</hi> was ful ſore againſt their will, aduaunced vnto the royall ſeate, by the voices
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:15177:69"/>of the aduerſe faction. They, whether impelled by lewdueſſe of diſpoſition, or adduced by hope of rewards and more liberall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, bicauſe they thought that nowe ſéeyng their owne ſide went to wracke, it were wiſedome for them to ſéeke new and more certaine friendes, fled vnto <hi>Synambaſſa,</hi> as vnto the chiefeſt Turkiſh captain, and their countreyman. By theſe horſemen <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambaſſa,</hi> and incontinently after <hi>Selym,</hi> vnderſtood all the counſels and intents of the enimies, and how great an ambuſhe <hi>Tomumbey</hi> had layde for them with ſingular ſuttietie and arte, into whiche they muſt néedes fall, vnleſſe they did forſake the high and direct waye. Whervpon they being guided by the ſame fugitiues, dyd fetche a great compaſſe about on the left hand, and before it was day came again into their old way, and with aranged battels, and produced ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (that there might be no ſtay to attach the fight) ſhewed themſelfs at the backs of their enimies, auoiding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> front of their campe. When <hi>Tomumbey</hi> ſawe this, he coniectured by the marche of his enimies, that his Ambuſhe had bene diſcloſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the treaſon of his owne men. But although he were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with incomparable grief of minde, for that al thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which he had doone with the toyle of ſo many men, and wyth ſo great endeuor, was quite daſhed, and caſte awaye in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tyme by ſpitefull Fortune: yet neuertheleſſe, as he was a very ſtout man, he incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly reuoked al his ſenſes vnto coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel &amp; wonted valor, &amp; calling vnto him al the captains, ſpéedily told them what he wold haue to be done. <hi>Tomumbey</hi> being placed in ſo great ſtraight of things, muſt doe all things at one time: he muſt giue the ſignall vnto the ſouldiours, wherby they were willed to mount on horſeback, &amp; to take their weapons, to turn the order of his cape, to arange his battels, to encorage his ſouldiors, &amp; to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into contrary quarters, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſe did require Al which things, as one chieftain could not do alone, but hardly and confuſedly, ſo were they haſtyly &amp; to halfes and peruerſly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred at one puſhe, by many. But the thing that did moſte hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpéedye dooying of all thynges, was the huddlyng togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all menne for to remoue the ordynaunce, the moſte of whiche were yll fauoured and houge péeces made of yron,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:15177:70"/>and ſette in greate ſtockes of wodde, wyth rings of yron after the rude and nauall workemanſhippe vſed in olde time: they by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their mighty waighte coulde not be moued out of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without the draught of many beaſtes, and greate thruſting and heauing with yron crows and leuers, and with the gréeuous laboure of men. But the greate péeces that were mounted on whéeles, being drawen by the witleſſe &amp; haſting multitude with the great clamor of thoſe that pulld, haled and ſhoued throughout all partes of the Campe, did with their tumultuous paſſage diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order thoſe that were mounting on their horſes, and the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours that were repairing vnto the enſignes. But two things were a great help vnto thoſe difficulties, that is to wit, the chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the ſouldiours, and the ſingular conſtancie of them all farre greater than a man would beléeue: for that they had not by any conceyued feare, fallen from their hope and harts, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hapneth in ſodaine chaunces, in whome, yea the olde ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, doe oftentymes forget their olde valor: but being twice vanquiſhed in battayle, they had alwayes reſumed greater confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and courage than they had before, bycauſe they perſwaded themſelues, that not valour and ſaill in fighte, but only Fortune ſayled them. Therfore when <hi>Tomumbey</hi> had ſet his men in array, and the ſouldiors with hote deſire of fight, had requeſted the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, he commaunded all the multitude of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> to fetche aboute their wings on the backe of their enimies, and to attache the fight firſte, ſo that the Turkiſhe horſemen might be troubled and diſordred, with a doubtfull daunger of fight, before that hée himſelfe had run foorth with his induced troupes. Streightwaye he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the great ordinance which had bene now brought about, and directed againſt the enimies, to be ſhot off. And incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently did the Turkes the ſame: who hadde once ſhot of theyr ſmaller &amp; greater péeces, when they were a iuſte diſtance of, and quickly charging them agayne, had now drawen them within an arrowes ſhoote of the Egyptian ordinaunce: they foughte a long tyme on eyther ſide with only often ſhooting off of their ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whyle that the armies approched. In the which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention, almoſt all the Egyptian gunners were ſlayne, and moſt of their artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:15177:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>hiſ mounted from their whéeles, and broken into péeces by the violence of the pellets of their enimies. For the <hi>Turke</hi> had very ſkilfull Gunners in his campe, whom he had allured by his great rewards, and riche entertamment out of <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> and ſpecially manie oute of that filthie rable of <hi>Iewes,</hi> who being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the pietie of king Ferdinand out of al the <hi>Spaynes,</hi> brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght afterward ſuch rare vnvſed and deadly artes into all the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to ſpite our men withall. The captaine of all theſe Gunners was one <hi>Iames,</hi> borne at <hi>Reggio</hi> in <hi>Lumbardie,</hi> a man of paſſing ſkil in theſe artes: who being enticed by the Turkiſhe giftes, had a little before forſaken the ſeruice of Chriſt, and reuolted vnto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets ſuperſtition. But after the fight is on both ſides brought vnto handeſtrokes, the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> raiſe a cruell and horrible cry, and in thrée quarters charge the <hi>Turkes</hi> with great valor: for <hi>Selym</hi> kéeping his olde order, ſo marched, that he approched in the forme of a croyſant. The Captain of the <hi>Aſians</hi> in the right wyng, was <hi>Mustaphas,</hi> and <hi>Innubaſſa</hi> of the <hi>Europeans</hi> in the left but he himſelf gouerned the middle battell, wherein was the Eſquadron of the <hi>Ianizars,</hi> with a great multitude of ordinance. But <hi>Synambaſſa,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made generall of the fielde, had choſen for himſelfe a certayne battell or bande of the moſte valianteſt horſmen, taken and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of all the companies, for to ſerue for al vncertain euents of the battell. Vnto whom he added out of <hi>Selyms</hi> eſquadron fiue hundred footmen of paſſyng proweſſe and ſwiftneſſe, that he being re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

So that when almoſt at one time <hi>Tomumbey</hi> had ſtoode in the middle battell againſt <hi>Selym,</hi> and the wings of the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> had encountred the <hi>Turkishe</hi> with equall fronte, and the <hi>Arabians</hi> had fought valiantly at their backes, as they had bene commaunded foure fights were holty attached at one tyme in diuers places.</p>
            <p>They that were preſent at this battell, do report, that through the cry of the Souldiors, the noiſe of the drummes and trumpets, the thundring of the artillerie, the cloude of the duſt, and the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the weapons, all mens mindes were ſo amazed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:15177:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>that they beeing all on bothe ſydes alyke, blynded with furye, they ruſhed foorthe wyth madde deſperaetneſſe, in ſuche ſorte, that neyther coulde the voyces and watche woordes bée diſcerned and knowne one from an other, nor the enſignes ſéene, nor the commaundements of the captains heard: they by mutual error ſlew a great number both of their owne felowes, and alſo their enimies without all regard: for neuer before that daye had any armies encountred togyther inflamed with greater hatred, neuer had two moſt mightie Emperors more conſtantly and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently ſhewed their valor of bodie and hart with leſſe care of life and ſafetie: For when both of them manifeſtly perceiued &amp; ſawe, that with like daunger of themſelues and their armies, they had ſet their liues and empires at ſixe and ſeuen, they alſo vnderſtode that there woulde be no other hope left vnto eyther of them, but that which the victorie it ſelfe would bring.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Gazelles</hi> enkindeled with deſyre of honour and reuenge, that he myghte repaye vnto the <hi>Europeans</hi> a foyle equal vnto that whiche he had receyued at <hi>Gaza,</hi> charging <hi>Innubaſſa</hi> with greate violence, had ouerrunne the formoſt &amp; the reſiſting troupes, had throwne downe the Guidons and the <hi>Arabians</hi> preaſſing on the victors at their backs, had made the vanquiſhing companies of al warres, where the ſtrength of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> and the <hi>Macedons</hi> were, to turne their backes, whiche neuer any enimye had ſéene before: Then <hi>Synambaſſa</hi> being redy and intentife both with mynde and ſtrength for al occaſion of victory, flew vpon the ſide of the enimies with a freſh and ſtrong companie of his men, and repaired the battaile which was inclined and fouly ſcattered.

They had a little before receyued a notable, detriment by the ordinance which was by chaunce ſhot from <hi>Selymb</hi> middle battell trauers the fielde. <hi>Mustaphas</hi> perceyuing it, and being very deſirous to aboliſh olde ignominy, very ſharply vrged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being once diſordered, and bringing in his troupes by wedges, brake thorough, ouer ranne and beate them downe, and being notorious all the battell ouer for his voice and armour adhorted the <hi>Aſians</hi> to thinke that they muſt now recouer eyther by paſſing proweſſe, or honorable death their auntient martiall honor, the whiche they had lately loſte at the battell of <hi>Alepo.</hi> Alſo at the ſame time <hi>Tomumbey</hi> hauyng bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken through the middle battell of the horſmen, was come vnto the footmen, and as he was a mightie man both in body and ſtrength, did many notable actes with his ſemitarre: and alſo the <hi>Arabians</hi> encloſed the outer wings of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and forced them in many places to fight with double front: when <hi>Selym</hi> aduaunced forward his eſquadron of footemen, the whych was hys onely and aſſured helpe in this extreamitie, whoſe charge neyther coulde the fierce and harded horſes, nor the victors men abide: for part of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours being harquebuſierz, did much muſchiefe when they were impaled with pikes, whoſe immoueable force beyng cloſed togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the array of one body, bare downe all that they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. Yet they fought with variable euent on both ſides, from the fourth houre of the day, vntill Sunne ſette, neyther was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the armies, which ſuffered not ſundry alterations, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune being now proſperous, &amp; then aduerſe: for both the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, &amp; the victors being made mad with mutuall and implacable rage; fought with obſtinate harts: the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> diſdaining that the victory ſhold be taken from them by thoſe men of whome they had ſlaine ſo many, but the <hi>Turkes</hi> chafing that they whome they had before vanquiſhed in two battells, did ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time reſiſt them:

            <p>
               <hi>Tomumbey,</hi> who no doubt was vanquiſhed, diſtruſting the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier loſſe of the fielde, firſt commanded the retreate to be founded, that his men, who now could not matche the eſquadron, myghte ſéeme not to haue bene beaten back, but ledde backe: The which thing he thought was of very great moment to eſtabliſh the harts of his ſouldiors, and alſo to reteyn his owne authoritie: for that ſame dame Fortune, who had deceyued his firſt hope, did ſéeme to promiſe vnto him, (who hoped, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in miſerie do) for better lot, proſperous euents of things, if that his heart quayled not, and he ſauyng that power whiche was yet lefte, woulde repaire the warres. The battell being broken off, by the commyng of the night, the <hi>Turkes</hi> who were victors, and had gained the ordinance and tentes of the enimies, purſued vntill it was late nights, the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> that marched to <hi>Caire</hi> almoſt in fléeing manner.</p>
            <p>In the flight were taken <hi>Biadarius,</hi> who could make no ſpéede, by reaſon of his gréeuous wounds, and with him <hi>Bidon,</hi> who had one of his knées broken with the ſhotte of a falcon, whiche dyd alſo kill his horſe. The next day <hi>Selym</hi> commaunded both of them to be ſlayne, either bycauſe they coulde not be healed, or for that it was decent, that he myght with ſo worthie ſacrifices appeaſe the ſpirite of <hi>Synambaſſa,</hi> for whom he ſingularly lamented. Although the <hi>Turks</hi> had nobly vanquiſhed, yet was their power vehemently decayed, yea through theſe fortunate battells. The fourth parts of them was quite ſpent with ſickneſſe and woundes: and alſo a great number of their horſſes were brought weake, through the toyle of the long fourney, and ſpecially by the wearineſſe of this day. For the which cauſes, <hi>Selym</hi> was conſtrained to renut ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of his olde manner in haſting: for he knewe not as yet the myndes and deuotion of the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> that inhabited <hi>Cair,</hi> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he yet vnderſtande by fame, in what place <hi>Tomumbey</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forned, and what he intended to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the meane tyme <hi>Tomum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi> with moſt intentiſe labor and trauell, fortified the gates, and all the wayes into the Citie, appointed Capitaines ouer euerye ſtreate, made adhortatorie orations in euery court, market place, and aſſemble of people: ſuffered not any light loytering to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15177:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the works, and finally, (whiche is thought to be the moſte hardeſt thing in calamitie, and danger) ſhewed a ſurpaſſing great hope, and a renued and ſingular valor in his vnappalled face and countenaunce. But the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> ouer and aboue neceſſitie, (the whiche doe vſe in extremities to enkindle and to make mad and deſperate, yea the very cowards) being ſtirred vp by emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did ſpéedily and couragiouſly execute the duties and offices of Captaines, for euery one of them, as his witte, inuention and induſtrie did bear, made ditches croſſe the moſt notorious ſtreats, and alſo laid mighty greate péeces of timber ouerthwart them: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſet in priuie pits, holes, and ditches very ſharpe ſtakes, vppon whom the enimies vnwarily falling might be gored: other furniſhed with gunnes according to their ſtore, the windows and houſes that ſtood in the turning of the ſtretes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wer much freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Al which things were doon with ſo great celeritie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man no not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioylieſt felow of all the <hi>Mamaluchs,</hi> made curteſie to take the ſpade, or to do any ſeruile or foule work: ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> all things ſéemed not to haue bin deuiſed before they were don &amp; finiſhed. Although the citie being very great &amp; very old, was encloſed with no walls, yet there were gates, &amp; but certain ways into it, of whom the one with direct and very broade way or ſtrete did lead from the Eaſt gate vnto the Caſtell, and into the middes of the Citie. The reſt of the ways into the Citie had very narrow pathes, and ill fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtreates, in whome the ordinaunce could not be well and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawen, neyther coulde aranged battells ſafely ioyne togither. Into this place and way had <hi>Tomumbey</hi> chiefly brought a power, bycauſe he vnderſtood that of neceſſitie the enimie muſt breake in at that place by reaſon of the wydeneſſe of the ſtreats, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarters of the citie father off, he kept with ſmall gards: but the inner and middle parts of the citie, where the caſtel ſtood: were guarded with a very ſtrong part of his power, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they being very intentiue, might ſpéedily run with ſuccor to al places of the citie, where y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the cry of the enimies, &amp; the perill of their fellows did call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bicauſe that the citie being of al other the greteſt, could not be defended round about the outward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe with ſo ſmall power, namely wayes lying open into it in euery place. But when <hi>Selym</hi> certenly knew that <hi>Tomu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bey</hi> was entred <hi>Caire,</hi> and al the <hi>Mamalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:15177:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>gathering their ſtrength into one, wold try the vttermoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the wars, he admoued his hoſt more neare vnto the Citie, and adhorted his ſouldiours to thinke that they muſt that day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly vanquiſh, and quite deſtroy their enimies, whom they had ſo often ouercome, and to take a little paine more, that they might receiue the rewardes of their former labours and victories: the which would be ſo many, and ſo greate, as they had before coueted with immoderate mindes: that there remained a few men wyth the forſaken and naked king, who bycauſe they beyng attached with woundes and feare, were not able to abide the fielde, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créed to expect at home in the ſight and armes of their wiues, and children, the ſupreame and laſte caſte of wretched life. That the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> of their owne accorde had ſent for him, for they deadly hating the name of the <hi>Mamaluches,</hi> did moſte gréedily exſpect their deſtruction, and did promiſe to fight from their houſes for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye that progenie of moſte wicked and ſauage men. But yet notwithſtanding, that the very abſolute victory of the whole wars conſiſted in the vtterly vanquiſhing of the remnauntes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and throughly affrighted army: bycauſe they could not be accompted ouercome, that yet hoped were yet in armes, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the ſiege of the Empire, and the greateſt Citie thereof.</p>
            <p>Therfore they ſhould think, that whereas their ſafety and glory, then alſo their whole ſtate and welfare did conſiſte in the euent of that day. But that it woulde be a thing almoſt of nought, and of no daunger, if that they woulde perſuade themſelues that they muſte néedes vanquiſh in this newe kinde of fight, as they hadde valiauntly done before vnder his conducte in all other. The ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours heartes burned for deſire of ſpoile, and being ready and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into rankes, exſpected the ſignall of the irruption: When <hi>Selym</hi> entring the Citie at <hi>Baſſuell</hi> gate, ſent in his horſemen at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places at once, but the <hi>Ianizars</hi> at the broader way: horſemen met with horſmen, and attached a cruell fight in the turnings of ſtreats, and narrow lanes, but the footemen drawing foorth their falcons and culuerings before them in their front, did flank with them all the ſtreats, along as they wente, making them naked of defendants. But when they were come vnto the munitions and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15177:74"/>ditches, and went about to remoue the logs, and greate beames that lay in their waye, and to paſſe the ditches: and on the other ſide the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> valiauntly obſiſted, they fought on both ſides with ſo greate valor, and ſo great pertinacie of harts, that neuer none in our memory encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred either more fiercely or more blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, for both the <hi>Mamaluchs</hi> &amp; the <hi>Turkes</hi> ſhewed all their ſtrength, and all their ſleights of warre, in this one daungerous fight, not being ignorant that they fought in this laſt encounter for life and Empire: ſéeing that ſporting fortune did ſet indifferently before them both ſupreame rewardes for the victors, and extreame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for the vanquiſhed. Very greate ſlaughter was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at the munitions, by reaſon that the <hi>Turks</hi> vnwarely run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the blinde and priue ditches, pits and holes fell downe into them by heapes, one vpon another, the hindermoſt thruſting them forwarde that were before: and other were gored on the ſharpe ſtakes. The <hi>Mamaluches</hi> their wiues and children did with manlike hardineſſe hurle and tumble down tiles and great ſtones on them that were beneath. On the other ſide, the <hi>Turkes</hi> woulde wyth their harquebuſſes fetche ſuche off as they coulde ſée in the windowes, and on the houſes, and breake open the doores where they ſaw any hurtefull thing hurled downe, and fight wythin the houſes wyth diuers euent. Alſo the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> beholding the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune now of the one ſide, and then of the other, did with diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion take for enimies and aſſaile them both, that vnto whether of them lot would giue the victory, they might ſéeme alſo to haue greately aided that partie. Many encounters were attached in diuers quarters at once, as they ranne into diuers ſtreates, yea and in ſundry partes of one ſtreate, now this company, now that lighted vpon new troups of the enimies, &amp; they that vrged the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in the front, were often intercluded by the enimies, &amp; were beaten down behind. The ways, and the ſpace that were left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen houſe and houſe, were (an horrible thing to behold,) ſo wet of the gore bloude that ranne oute of the ſlaine men that laye on leapes euery foote, that the raiſed duſt, whyche at the beginning was very thicke, was nowe quite layd. Yet neuertheleſſe the aire was darkened wyth the ſmoke and miſte of the gunnes, and the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:15177:75"/>cloudes of arrowes, and ſo greate was the crie of the ſouldiours, the claſhing of the weapons, the thundering of the ordinaunce, that the earth ſéemed to tremble and quake, and the houſes to bée torne into péeces. They fought continually two days, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nights with doubtfull fortune: but yet ſo that the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> who being fewe in number, &amp; were not able to ſuſtain the labour and watching, had withdrawen themſelues by giuing backe by little and little into the inner partes of the Citie, forſaking the formoſt munitions. The third day when the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> were in the very pitch of the perill of all their whole ſtate, and all that euer they had (which thing is wont to augment the ſupreme enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, endeuours and hartes of all men) they renued the fight wyth ſuch ſurpaſſing valor, that they droue the <hi>Turks</hi> a great way backe and intercepted certaine of their falcons. Which chaunce, they ſaye, made <hi>Selym</hi> to diſpaire of the victory, and then he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the houſes to be ſet on fire in all places, he being alſo impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto that heinous and cruell proclamation almoſte by iuſte wrath conceyued againſt the <hi>Aegiptians,</hi> bycauſe that a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Innusbaſſa</hi> had bin gréeuouſly wounded in the heade in <hi>Selyms</hi> ſight with a ſtone throwen out at a windowe. Now were the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes light on fire, now was heard the houling of the wéeping and ſuppliauntly entreating <hi>Aegiptians,</hi> and new the <hi>Turkes</hi> fightyng ſomewhat faintly, expected that the retraite ſhoulde bée ſounded: when ſée, newes was brought by many men at once, that in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarter the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> being beaten from their ground, and defeated by vrging <hi>Mustaphas,</hi> had repoſed their laſte refuge in running away: for <hi>Mustaphas</hi> through the intimation of certaine <hi>Aegiptians,</hi> and fugitiue <hi>Mamaluches,</hi> had come vnto a very large ſtreate, where the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> had ſette their horſes ready bridled and ſadled: that if any ill chaunce happened, they might haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thither, and taking their horſes, flée vnto thoſe nexte pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whither they had determined to go. He got all thoſe horſes and ledde them awaye, hauing chaſed their guarde, the which, as in a parte of the Citie, that they did nothing ſuſpect, was very weake, conſiſting wholy of boyes, and horſe kéepers. This thing (as it commonly happeneth in waighty and vnlooked for chaunces) did
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:15177:75"/>maruellouſly wraken their valour and impreſſion. Wherefore when hope of flight was taken awaye, and they perceyued them ſelues to be encloſed rounde aboute, and that the fight was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteined by none other hope, and by none other helpe and aide, than proweſſe, they being vanquiſhed by their own confeſſion, turned their backs. Many haſting vnto <hi>Nilus</hi> with <hi>Tomumbey,</hi> who had in vaine tried all artes of valiauncy, wiſedome and deuiſe, that hée might not be vanquiſhed in this battell, paſſing ouer the riuer by boate, wente into the region of <hi>Seiectica.</hi> Another multitude hidde themſelues in the houſes of the <hi>Aegiptians,</hi> and in moſte ſhameful lurking dennes. But aboue a thouſande and fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth of the valiaunteſt of the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> fledde vnto the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Temple in all the Citie, where after that they hadde long time defended them ſelues, as oute of a Caſtell, bycauſe they woulde not yéelde but vppon honourable conditions: at the laſte beyng vanquiſhed by thirſte, wearineſſe, woundes, and ordinaunce, they yéelded themſelues vnto the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the victor. A part of them were ſlaine preſentlye before the Churche by the angrye Souldiours: <hi>Selym</hi> winking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, and parte were certaine dayes after caried downe the Riuer to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> When the victory enclined, <hi>Selym</hi> ſent two bands to put out the fires, and alſo ſending aboute cryers throughout al the Citie, cauſed proclamation to be made, that all the <hi>Mama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luches</hi> that would come in, and yéelde them ſelues, within twelue houres ſhould haue no hurt, but all found after that time, ſhould die for it, and alſo that hée woulde giue rewardes vnto all thoſe <hi>Aegiptians</hi> that woulde diſeloſe the <hi>Mamaluches</hi> that lurked, and contrariwiſe incontinently ſticke them that had hidden any: and ſelling their wiues and children, burne their houſes. Vppon the brute of this proclamation, a great number of them came abroad, who were ſtraightway put in yrons, and alſo afterward all moſte cruelly ſlain in priſon, for that they were ſaid to haue practiſed an eſcape. But diuers that wold not violate the rights of friendſhip and faith by bewraying their fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, being accuſed by their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, ſuffred loſſe of life, dying very conſtantly for their friendes.</p>
            <p>After this, the ſouldiors beyng made fierce through the victory,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:15177:76"/>ſearched all places, drewe out all them that were hidden, and ſlew them, and alſo ſpoyled the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> their houſes, and lefte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhut and ſecreate. The very ſame day <hi>Gazelles</hi> happened to come vnto <hi>Caire,</hi> who had béen ſent a litle before into <hi>Thebais</hi> to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy <hi>Arabians,</hi> and to hyre aides. Then hée ſéeing the ſtate to bée quite euerted, and that hée was able to do no good, eyther by hand or counſell, came in with thrée <hi>Arabian</hi> Capitaynes, and many horſemen, and yéelded himſelfe vnto <hi>Selym,</hi> who entertained hym with all his traine very honourably, euery man according to hys calling.</p>

But <hi>Palice</hi> both gréenouſly offended wyth the raſheneſſe and arrogancie of <hi>Albert,</hi> and alſo moued with the nothing tymely inclination of <hi>Lautrech,</hi> prayſed in déede at large the good will and deuotion of the Switzers, but could in no caſe abide to heare the counſell of aſſaulting the Campe, as a deuice full of extreame madneſſe, and deadly deſperatneſſe: often ſaying that he, who had wared olde in the <hi>Italian</hi> warres, did very wel know the valor of young <hi>Peſcara,</hi> who alwayes vſeth to fight luſtily and the artes of olde <hi>Proſpero,</hi> who had learned to lodge his army ſkilfully to the diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of his enimy, &amp; with his owne chiefeſt and higheſt praiſe.

In déede the Lorde <hi>Lautrech,</hi> who had the ſupreame gouernement, might fight with diſaduantage both then, &amp; alſo at al other tymes, when he wold: but it was the duty &amp; part of a wiſe Generall, neuer to prouoke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimy, vnleſſe he hauing before ſurely ſhifted the eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, might with firme reaſon aſſuredly promiſe himſelfe vndoubted victorie. But then thus (anſwered the Lord <hi>Lautrech</hi>) we nede not ſlouthful lingring in ſitting ſtill, but lyuely valour in fight tore-couer the honor and Duchy loſt: the which doubtleſſe can not be done, if we do ſuffer the Switzers, who are now going away, to depart home and do no feate of proweſſe. Wherefore make your ſelues ready to fight, that we may this day ende the warres one way or an other. Thervnto replied <hi>Palice:</hi> God aſſiſt the mad and deſperate: I for my part, that I may not ſéem to haue ſhu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned the perill, will certes fight on foote in the forewarde of the footemen: yée French horſmen, behaue your ſelues to day valiantly, that in a hard caſe, rather fortune than courage, may ſéeme to haue fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you. So before the Sun was vp (it was the .xxix. day of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill) <hi>Albert</hi> leadeth foorth his regiments of Switzers (they were about fiftene thouſand) with the ordinance, being puffed vp with ſo fooliſh, or certes fatal pride, that he would not one whit be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in any thing by either <hi>Lautrech,</hi> or <hi>Palice,</hi> Captaines of greate ſkill, but wyth barbarous ſtatelineſſe, promiſed that hée woulde chardge the Emperialls full in the face.

It was enioyned vnto the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were on the left hand, to back the Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers, beyng therby quite out of daunger, or certes very far from any. Moreouer <hi>Iohn de Medici</hi> was commaunded to goe before all the battelles wyth hys horſemen, who were verye paſſyng excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,

The captain of the <hi>Almaynes</hi> was <hi>George Frondesberg,</hi> a notoriou man for hys mightie body and ſtrength: the harquebuſters ſtandyng before the pikes occupied all the whole length of the front: when <hi>Peſcara</hi> commanded by as new and witty, as afterwarde happy deuiſe, that they ſhould not ſette fire to their péeces before that they had ſéene volagues diſchardge at his commaundement.

               <hi>Peſcara</hi> had intelligence by a fire made out of the top of the toure, that <hi>Arrio</hi> was fortunately entred the towne: he commaunded <hi>Salſede</hi> to breake open the wall of the Parke, deliuering vnto him to doe it withall, Rammes made after the auncient forme: and alſo yron.

But when they had receyued word that he was entred the Parke, they ſhoulde incontinentlye followe with their bandes.

He alſo commaunded that all the cariages of the armie ſhoulde go forth into the high way towardes <hi>Lodi,</hi> with a garde of a troupe of light horſemen, and alſo commaunded an other companie of horſemen to take waye that laye vpon the left hande, that if there were eſpies in the Campe, they being diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and deceyued by ſo many and diuers goings forth, and ſo ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For the wall being made of Bricke after the olde buylding, was verye ſtrong, and reſiſted the Rammes with ſingular contumacie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were driuen againſt it with the armes and ſtrength of whole bandes. The firſt man of all that was ſent into the Parke by <hi>Peſcara,</hi> was <hi>Alphons</hi> Marques of <hi>Guaſto,</hi> with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianteſt of the <hi>Spaniſhe</hi> and <hi>Almaine</hi> footemen, and thrée compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of horſemen.

And there was among all other (that he might lodge the more quietly and wholſomely) the Popes Ambaſſadour <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome Aleander,</hi> a man verye excellentlye learned, and of greate fame, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So when the enni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had flowen thither vnlooked for, all that whole companye was ſtreightwaye oppreſſed, and all thynges were in a trice ſpoyled, and then <hi>Guaſto</hi> gathering his bandes togither into one, as <hi>Peſcara</hi> had commaunded him, he did ſet vppe the Emperiall Enſignes within the diche of the houſe. In the meane time, <hi>Peſcara</hi> immediatly bringeth in the reſt of the footemen: <hi>Lancy</hi> and <hi>Burbon</hi> doe ſende in the horſemen: the artillerie is drawen into the Parke by Oxen and horſes, although hardlye yet at one tyme. The fieldes are filled with whyte linnen battayles: for all the Emperialles had by <hi>Peſcara</hi> his Edicte put their waſte-coates
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:15177:89"/>vppermoſt, and they which lacked waſte coates, and ſpeciallye the <hi>Almaines,</hi> had ſo couered their breaſtes with whyte paper, that by the vnwonted whyte, the weapons gliſtering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene, a ſhewe of a greater and more terrible hoſte might hée preſented vnto the eyes of the amazed Frenche men. For nowe the dawning hadde brought in fayre broade daye light, and the ſomewhat thicke cloude which had bene ſpreade ouer the fields, began to vaniſhe awaye by little and little. But the Frenche King, who perpetually watched intentiue for all chaunces, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appalled with that noueltie, and therewithall, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came eyther a King of high heart, or a ſkilfull and ſtoute Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, giueth ſigne by the Trumpetie, that euery man taking his armour and weapons, ſhoulde ſtande by the Enſignes, hee commaundeth the great ordinance to be drawen forth by the harneſſed horſes, and by the Captaines (as néede was) admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth all things ſpéedily, but yet not without all tumult and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore, for he had learned long before by the report of <hi>Greco Iuſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano,</hi> what the enimies went about by thicke thumping againſt the wall of the Parke, and when he hearde the thundering of the enimies ordinance, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, nor any thing fearing the malignitie of fortune, ſayde vnto the Captaines that ſtoode rounde about him: that he went not raſhlye forth to fight the battell, neuer calling reaſon into counſell, but with a right and noble iudgement, ſéeing that he coulde with moſt equall lot wiſh nothing more commodious for the winning of the victorie, than to get his enimies not within diches and munitions, (as it had often happened at other tymes) but in the open and wyde fieldes, and in their marche and iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: where it might be ſéene, what the ſtanding Eſquadrons of <hi>Switzers</hi> &amp; <hi>Almaines</hi> were worth, what force y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt ſtrong horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had, what good the great ordinance flying our ſwift whéeles coulde doe. For againſt the Lanſquenets, who onely of all other ſéemed moſt to be feared, he did rightly ſet the <hi>Switzers,</hi> as their matches indiſcipline, furniture, ſtrength, and courage, ſo alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wais their moſt bitter enimies by naturall hatred. But he thought that the <hi>Spaniardes</hi> woulde not be able to abide, no not the firſt impreſſion of the blacke regiment of Lanſquenets, if that they woulde kéepe their rankes in thicke araye: neyther if that they woulde fight ſcattered, and running hither and thither, that they coulde eſcape from being ouerrunne by the horſemen. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe theſe things were foreſéene, and prouided with very good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and reaſon, if that (as it moſt times happeneth) inſolent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune being foe vnto noble deuiſes, had not preuerted all thinges by confuſe order. For they ranne togither in ſundrie places with ſo great confuſion of horſemen and footemen blended togither, that neuer any armies fought more confuſely and ſcatteringly.

               </gap>ke faſt in a watrie plot: it came to paſſe, that they which were laſt in order, were contrarie to hope, the firſt of all that met the Frenchmen their enimies. For the King ſéeing them ſeparated farre from the reſt of the armie, did out of hande ſende thither <hi>Philip</hi> Lord <hi>Brion,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fredericke</hi> Earle of <hi>Bozzolo,</hi> with a ſtrong companie of men of armes, &amp; with certain ſpeedy péeces of ordinance, and alſo certain ſmall looſe companeis of footemen were ioyned with them. They doe ſpéedily his commaundement, and doe ſet vpon the enimies being buſied in weyghing vp the ordinance. There is a cruell fight: but although the Emperials fought with ſingular valor, yet they ſuſteyning neyther the ſtorme of the ordinance, nor the force of the horſemen, tooke the woode adioyning to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by the garde of the trées, from the violence of the inſulting horſemen. So the Frenchmen quickly cutting off the legs of the drawing beaſtes, doe get the ordinance, and with the ſame vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent purſuite doe enter the woode, where being oppreſſed with the diſaduauntage of vnaccuſtomed encounter, <hi>Sebaſtian Squaccia,</hi> a man of paſſing prowes was ſlayne, and with him certaine ſtout petie Captaynes and Enſigne bearers, yea, and foure whole bandes. This exployt being proſperouſly done in the ſight of both armies, as it did greatlye augment the courage of the King and the French men, ſo did it ſtrike <hi>Peſcara</hi> with incredible ſorowe, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he coulde not ſuccour them. But on the other ſide, he being gréedie of fight, as ſoone as he ſawe the Kings armie (the which he did not thinke woulde haue come forth into the fielde out of their campe) wonderfully reioyced, as though he had conceyued the victorie. Neyther ſtayed he, but immediatlye ſent <hi>Falzi,</hi> an horſeman of his acquaintance, vnto <hi>Lanoy</hi> to admoniſhe him to ſtay his marche, and all things ſet apart, and turning the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons towardes the enimies, incontinently to encounter them: he alſo ſignifieth the ſame vnto <hi>Burbon,</hi> and <hi>Nicolas</hi> Earle of <hi>Salern,</hi> and gallopeth himſelfe to call <hi>Guaſto,</hi> but <hi>Guaſto</hi> as ſoone as he had ſéene his enimies, leauing <hi>Mirabello</hi> marched backe to <hi>Verna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula,</hi> and ſetting his men in aray of battel, had turned the enſignes
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:15177:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>towardes the enimies: for he did not thinke that in this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, he ought to obey that which had bene at the firſte commaunded him, but ſpéedily to vſe the newe counſell whiche chaunce did preſent. Then <hi>Peſcara</hi> ſayde: this is well brother, you haue done that which I woulde you ſhould: wherefore haſte you on the lefte hande vnto the ennimie with ſpéedie pace, and valiauntlye endeuour that the victorie maye moſte ſpecially<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he had thus ſayde, he flewe vnto the Lanſquenets, in whoſe valor and ſtrength he did foreſée that the weyght of the battayle, and the whole victorie did conſiſte. In the meane time, a troupe of the Emperiall light horſemen, boldly charging the blacke Eſquadron of <hi>Almaines,</hi> were eaſilye repelled, and thruſt backe with foule diſorder, into the valley of <hi>Vernacula</hi> that laye vnderneath, and alſo the Frenche ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce being commodiouſly drawen with ſwift horſes into all quarters with marueylous ſkill and celeritie, did ſo annoye the enimies, that the <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> yea laying their breſtes flatte vpon the grounde, coulde ſcarſe eſcape the fléeing pellets through the benefite of the lower greunde, and <hi>Lanoy</hi> and <hi>Alarco</hi> were forced to bring their fearefull troupes of horſemen behinde a countrie Cottage, which happily defended them. But then the king being vohemently incited by theſe, as it were beginnings of not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full victorie, and moued both by the diſpoſition of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and alſo through the adhortation of his Captaines, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing to giue the ſignall, &amp; to diſmarche to giue the charge. The reſt do the ſame: and before all other <hi>Palice</hi> the leader of the auantgarde, did in the right wing charge the Emperiall horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were now luſtily turned. This feaſe and charge of the Frenchmen, as it was gréeuous and terrible to <hi>Lanoy,</hi> ſo by the opinion of many men it ſéemed to haue afterward not doubtfully caried away the victorie from the Frenchmen: for by that head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long and ſpéedie departure, not onely the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Almaines,</hi> who coulde not followe after with equall pace, were bared of the guarde of the horſemen, but alſo the vſe of the ordinaunce was for a great part taken awaye, for that the Gunners were forced to ceaſe ſhooting, leaſt that they ſhoulde ſtrike both the ſides and

But neuer in our age did horſemen encounter togither more couragiouſlye and ſtrongly: for on both ſides olde beaten Captaines and horſemen, fought with burning heartes, not for only glorie (a thing yet that doth moſt ſharpen the edge of true proweſſe) but alſo for the Empire of <hi>Italie.</hi> The Frenchmen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gréedie of reuenge, ſought in all places of the encounter moſt narrowly for <hi>Burbon,</hi> as a forſaker of the King and his countrie, with the ignominie of treaſon and perfidiouſneſſe: but all in vaine, for <hi>Burbon</hi> that he might more ſafely ſhewe his valor, had giuen his Cognizaunces vnto his familiar freude the Lord <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perant,</hi> and fought himſelfe in his coate, and apparailed like vnto a priuate ſouldiour.

But when the battaile was incontinently attached, and very hote, and <hi>Lanoy</hi> had all his ſenſes and memorie ſo vehemently occupied about the preſent and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter, that he ſent no man to call his coſin: the yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman thinking that he muſt in any caſe obey his vncles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, and the preceptes of Martiall diſcipline, ſtoode ſtill, and moued not vntill the ende of the battaile: neyther could he be adduced to go forth into the field by any intreatie or chaſing of the horſemen, vnto <hi>Lanoy,</hi> being for theſe cauſes in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, and hardlye ſuſteyning the force of the Kings battayle. <hi>Peſcara</hi> (who viewing all things and places with wonderfull and preſent prudence, and ſpecially with intentiue eye, did méete with and redreſſe euery difficultie in this place and in that, finallye in all partes, ſent about viij.

And alſo he ſet ſtreight after them a band of armed Pikes: &amp; then the harquebuſiers being ſafe through their garde, did more boldlye and inceſſantlye vſe their harquebuſſes. When the Kinges horſemen had receyued this great incommoditie, they not being able to abide thicke togither in troupe, and thinking that if they did ſpreade abroade their wings, they ſhould be able to repugn with leſſe peril: brake their aray, ſcattered themſelues abrode. But when by this deuiſe they met with more infeſtuous fortune, they being relyed againe into a thicke troupe, for ſhame and anger runne vpon the Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers.

This was a new kinde of fight and not vſuall, but very cruell and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, bicauſe that the vſe of noble prowes in the horſemen was vtterly loſt, the Harquebuſſers with great aduauntage diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching all before they coulde reache them with their Launces: neyther could, yea the moſt ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt armes do any good long, but that they which were thicke and many togither, were ſlayne by the thinne and fewe, and often the moſt famous Captaines and horſemen were euerywhere ſtricken downe with vnreuenged death, by the baſe and common footemen.

But then might you ſee (an incredible thing to be ſpoken) that nation which a little before were feared of all men for their excellent &amp; approued valor in the fielde, and ſpecially in a battayle, quite forgetting both honor &amp; diſcipline, and alſo their ingrafted fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, to refuſe to fight welny before they had once charged their Pykes, and for feare of honorable death, ſought an infamous and moſt ſhamefull deſtruction in the very déepe riuer. <hi>Floran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> in vayne going about to kéepe them ſtill in the battell, and

Neyther with leſſe deformitie didde alſo another battallion of <hi>Switzers</hi> flée, which, as it was fuller for number of bandes, ſo it ſtoode a whyle vnmoued, but when they were a farre ouerwhelmed by the Harquebuſſies, ſpreading them ſelues rounde about them, with certayne perpetuall ſhoure of pellettes, and the valyaunteſt of the petie Captaynes (as it doth moſte commonlye happen) were ſlayne in the foremoſt rankes, and when they had ſéene the diſcomfiture of the Kings horſemen, they hurling away their Pykes, turned their backs.

The Emperialles were woode angrye that the blacke <hi>Almaynes,</hi> contemning and ſcorning the Emperours Maieſtie, and deſpiſing the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the <hi>Almayne</hi> name, had come with Mercenarye armes, for to beſiege and aſſaulte their brethren and couſins, in the behalfe of the Frenche men their auncient ennimies. On the other ſide, the blacke <hi>Almaynes</hi> thought it moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to doe moſte valiant ſeruice for that King who had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them ſo many yeares by his liberall wages, to kéepe the ſayth of their othe, and in no caſe to admitte ought that ſhould be vnfitting for olde ſouldiours.

When the Eſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons drewe neare one vnto the other, <hi>Longamentes,</hi> a verye noble Captayne of <hi>Auſpurg,</hi> came forth alone before the battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the blacke <hi>Almaynes,</hi> chalenging vnto the combat <hi>George Frondesberg</hi> and <hi>Mark Sitſch,</hi> by lyfting vp his hande, and with a loude voyce.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:15177:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>So when both battalions ranne togyther, and <hi>Peſcara</hi> galloped his horſe on the enimies, he was wounded in the face (which was bare) and afterwarde his horſe being ſlayne vnder him, he was alſo thruſt through the left legge with a Pyke. In this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible claſhing togither of weapons, he had doutbleſſe bene op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Pykes both of his enimies and his friendes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that nowe at this pynche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he coulde hardly wraſtle out himſelfe, firſt an horſeman of his owne houſholde, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde the petie Captaynes and Enſigne bearers that were neare at hande, had not with much adoe got him out and ſaued him. In the meane tyme, <hi>Frondesberg</hi> and <hi>Sitch</hi> ſtretching out in length their battalions on both ſides with wonderfull ſkill, for to encloſe their enimies, receiued them as it were into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and then ſtreyghtway claſped togither their wings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing them in rounde, and fiue them all, who reſiſted verye manfully and conſtantlye, ſo that one regiment fighting with thrée, and therefore repugning with vnhappy valor, almoſt no man of the blacke regiment eſcaped.

Moreouer <hi>Galeazo San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerino</hi> galloping his horſe this way and that way, with ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cunning, repelleth the enimies, and fighteth valiantly: but at length being ſlayne in the Kings ſight, payde that by honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ende of lyfe which he owed vnto the Kings great fauour towards him, and the fame of his noble name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When his horſe fell downe vnder him, he calling vnto <hi>VVillyam</hi> Lorde <hi>Langey,</hi> a noble Gentleman, who endeuoured to helpe him in his fatall fall, ſayde: Sonne, let me take my fortune, and runne backe as faſt as you can to defende the King: and if you doe eſcape, frendly reuerence the memory of my name, and honorable end. It was a battell of all other moſt deadlye and aduerſe for the horſemen, for the deadly bullets were ſhotte from all partes by the nymble <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> who were ſpred rounde about them: and nowe they vſed not ſuch ſmall péeces as they had done a little before, but greater, whome they called Arcubuſſes, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they woulde ſtryke through, not onely a man of armes, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes two men and two horſes at a ſhot, ſo that the field be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrewed ouer with the miſerable lying along of the noble horſemen, and the heapes of the dying horſes, did both hinder the valor of the horſemen, if that they would endeuour to break in with thicke troupe: and alſo if that anye man accounted his lyfe dearer than his honor, he coulde not cedily and ſpéedily flée, for the heapes of the ſtayne that lay euery foote in his way lyke vnto great rampires.

But then <hi>Philippino</hi> aſſembling togither all the Captaines and Maiſters in the Admirall galley, ſpake almoſt theſe words vnto them, ſhewing with his finger the fléete of his enimies comming towards them: Valiant fellowes (ſayd he) and good countrymen of inuincible prowes, a great honor is ſet before vs (as I ſée) by almoſt a certaine victorie, ſithe that we doe ſurpaſſe in number of galleyes, and all Martiall furniture, yea and courage of hearte and ſkill in ſea fight. Let our enimies in Gods name be, as they doe boaſte of themſelues, noble warriours by lande, doubtleſſe they will not be able in conflicte by ſea, eyther readily to trauerſe their grounde, or yet to caſte themſelues into rings, ſéeing that they ſhall fight among the benches of the rowe ſlaues, and on the ſtreight hatches, and muſt receyue the pellets of the Gunnes, as chaunce ſhall bring them, no place being left eyther to retire, or to leape aſide, namely the great number of the rowers empea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them: So that they lying open vnto ſtrokes, and being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with their daunger, will not be in any wiſe able eyther to ſtande ſtoutly, or to chaunge their place politikely. Therefore ſéeing that we muſt not once thinke of retiring backe, and leaſt we doe incurre diſhonor, muſt néedes fight with our offered eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: perſuade your ſelues that the glorie of our aunceſtors got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ſo many proſperous conflictes by ſea, is repoſed in your valiant handes and ſkill. This glorie (as I thinke) ought euerye good Citizen, not only to conſerue, but alſo to augment, leaſt that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:15177:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>otherwiſe we may be thought both of our fellowes, and alſo of our enimies to be degenerates, and men forgetfull of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. But thinke that <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> our Admirall is preſent, &amp; will be a witneſſe of prowes &amp; cowardiſe, for to giue rewards vnto the valiant, or by equal right, ignomie vnto the cowardes. The Captaynes and Maiſters gaue ſuch a ſhoute as the chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and gréedy of fight doe vſe, and in fewe wordes ſetting or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der howe to receyue and inuade the enimie, returned vnto their galleyes, that they might aptly make readye all things whiche ſhoulde be néedefull for the inſtant fight. The ſumme of their ſpéedie decrée was this: that <hi>Philippino</hi> ſhould directly go againſt the enimie with his fiue galleyes, but <hi>Nicolas Lomellino</hi> rowing into the mayne ſea with his thrée galleys, ſhoulde fetch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe about, and after the conflicte was begon, in commodious time, couragiouſly runne vpon the deckes and ſides of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies their gallyes, and chiefly of the Admirall, <hi>Philippino</hi> laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching forth from the forelande into the open ſea, offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vnto the conflict, neyther did <hi>Vgo</hi> refuſe it, and the rather for that he beléeued, that theſe thrée galleys of <hi>Lomellino,</hi> whom we ſpake of, had fled away for feare, and did thinke that the fiue of <hi>Philippino</hi> ſhould fight with him much ouermatched. When they drewe neare, and bothe the Admirall galleyes directed their ſtemmes for mutuall encounter, <hi>Guaſto</hi> with wholſome counſell adhorted <hi>Vgo</hi> to haſten firſt to ſhoote off his great gunne called a <hi>Baſiliſco,</hi> that the thicke ſmoke thereof might take away from the enimie all certaine ſtroke. But <hi>Vgo</hi> (who woulde be accounted very ſkilfull in ſea affaires, and a little before had gaineſayd at the Iſle of <hi>Crapi</hi> all the olde maiſters of the galleys, who diſſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the fight, vpbrayding them with cowardiſe) deferred ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to ſhoote, that <hi>Philippino</hi> being very diligentlye intentiue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and aptly leuelling the firſt ſhotte of his <hi>Baſiliſco</hi> with pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Emperiall Admirall, paſſed from the ſtemme to the decke, ſlaying thirtie men, and among them <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Cardonna,</hi> a kinſeman of <hi>Guaſto,</hi> and <hi>Leo Taſsino,</hi> one borne in <hi>Forrara,</hi> who had ſlayne vpon a quarrell betwéene <hi>Guaſto</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> the Duke his ſonne, a gentleman of great hope, and <hi>Guſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

But the <hi>Baſiliſco</hi> of the Emperiall Admirall did no great harme vnto the <hi>Genoueys,</hi> bicauſe that the Gunner coulde not ſée howe to ſhoote right for the ſmoke of the <hi>Genoway</hi> péece, and alſo the <hi>Geneuoys</hi> laye not ſo open as did the <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> vpon the open hatches, but being defended with a ſure netting made of ſtrong boordes, ſhot with Harquebuſſes a crooke out of loope holes, they themſelues being ſafely couered. But in the meane time three of the Emperiall galleyes, of whome one was called the <hi>Gibba,</hi> the maiſter whereof was <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> a <hi>Genoway,</hi> but the Captaine of the ſouldiours, was <hi>Ceſar Faramuſca,</hi> the other two, the <hi>Secamia,</hi> and the <hi>Villamarina,</hi> ſo called of their valiant mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>Secamo</hi> and <hi>Villamarino,</hi> runne vpon two of <hi>Doria</hi> his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, named the <hi>Pilgrime</hi> and the <hi>Handmaide,</hi> and fight very ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, and the hardie <hi>Spaniſhe</hi> ſouldiours leape into them, when <hi>Lomellino</hi> ſawe this, he timelye turned his courſe, and at one time his thrée galleys, diſcharged their thrée <hi>Baſiliſcoes</hi> vpon the Emperiall Admirall. The Moore hitting the decke, ſtrake off the rudder. The <hi>Neptune</hi> ſlaying certaine of the galley flaues, did ſo ſhake the Maſte, that the ſayles yards fell downe, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed manye with the fall, and among them <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Trani,</hi> who had ſuccéeded his father <hi>Antonello</hi> in the office of Maiſter of the ordinance vnto the Emperour. Finallye the Miſtres brake of the Emperiall beake, and ſore annoyed the ſtemme. Neyther ſtayed they, but ſpéedily rowed for to ayde the <hi>Pilgrime,</hi> and the <hi>Handmaide,</hi> that were nowe bourded. Then the <hi>Moore</hi> turning about hir ſelfe verye artificially, diſcharged ſuch a tempeſt of ſmall and meane ſhot, which fell as thicke as hayle vppon the <hi>Gibba,</hi> that ſhe was brought into great daunger. For beſides the ſlaues and the Mariners, and ſouldiours fouly ſlayne, <hi>Ceſar Feramuſca</hi> was alſo borne ouer the boorde deade with a ſhot of a ſmall Falcon, and <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Maſter was ſhot into the thigh, and <hi>Baredo</hi> a Captaine of an hundreth <hi>Harquebuſiers,</hi> was hurte with thrée deadly woundes. In another quarter two Emperiall galleys called the <hi>Perpenniana</hi> and the <hi>Oriana</hi> encountred with the <hi>Mermayde</hi> and the <hi>Fortune,</hi> whom when they had much endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:15177:101"/>and almoſt bourded, they ſéeing the diſcomſiture of their fellowes, left and fled awaye in ſafetie: for they deſpayring of the victorie, bicauſe they ſaw the baner of the Admirall thrown down, and the <hi>Secamia</hi> and the <hi>Villamarina</hi> circumuented, and the <hi>Pilgrime</hi> and the <hi>Handmayde</hi> whom they had bourded, recouered, and the ſmall fléete of long Boates and Foyſtes ſcattered, had choſen rather to ſaue themſelues for the Emperour, than with the reſt to fall into the ſame miſchaunce of aduerſe fortune: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that this counſell, as to ſoone put into practiſe was bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of many. Incontinently after the flight of theſe two gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes, the victorie was graunted vnto <hi>Philippino:</hi> for <hi>Vgo</hi> being ſlayne with a ſmall Falcon, <hi>Guaſto</hi> being gréeuouſly burnt with wilde fire in the necke neare vnto the care, and alſo his helmet ſore battered to his heade by ſtones, and other things throwne downe from the toppes, and <hi>Aſcanio de Colonna</hi> being wounded in the right hande, and in one of his féete, yéelded themſelues vnto <hi>Lomellino.</hi> In the winning of this victorie the galley ſlaues of the <hi>Moares</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> ſtoode <hi>Philippino</hi> in great ſteade.

               </hi> had brought a bande of Harquebuſiers with him, euerys horſeman taking an harquebuſter behinde him, who with their ſhot much vexed the enimies. But when <hi>Maramaldo</hi> ſawe that the enimies bended towardes <hi>Gabiniano</hi> from <hi>Camalenbo,</hi> where they lodged the might before, be croſſing ouer the mountaines and woodes, was come to <hi>Gabiniano.</hi> And alſo <hi>Vitelli</hi> by another ſhorter waye, but verye yll, was encamped not farre from the towne. In the meane tyme <hi>Fernaio</hi> tyding on a whyte horſe wyth his ſworde drawen, adhorted his men kéeping their araye, to haſte to take the towne firſt, the whiche was then in ſight, and to propell the vrging borſemen of their enimies, for the Earle of <hi>Ciuitella</hi> and <hi>Atſula</hi> fighting with ſingular vallor, did not only ſuſteyne their enimies, but alſo the charge, being on both ſides often renued along the ſheluing bankes, forced their enimies to retyre with turned backes. Whyle, that they thus ſoughte with great tumult and noyſe, for that certayne bandes of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers had bene ſent forth out of <hi>Fernaio</hi> his battell, and alſo the ſhotte of, <hi>Pompey:</hi> (who as we haue ſhewed you) had bene ſent to be a garde vnto the horſemen, had intermedled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the conflicte of the horſemen, and nowe manye men had bene ſlain on hoth ſides, when <hi>Maramaldo</hi> got into the town at the farther gate, and at a part of the wall which was eaſilye throwne downe at the verye ſame time that <hi>Fernaio</hi> entred in at the foregate. Ind thus a cruell and bloudie fight was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted along the towne, ſo that they fought with great contention in the middes of the Market place: for <hi>Fernaio</hi> leaping off from his horſe, and taking a footemans Pyke, layde about him luſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. Neyther fayled <hi>Maramaldo</hi> vnto his men, but caſting them
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:15177:106"/>into the forme of a wedge, fought fiercely to wynne the whole ſtréete. In the meane tune, part of <hi>Fernaio</hi> his battell following their Captaine, fought valiantly in the towne, but part deflee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting along the towne wall, and hauing gotten a commodious place among the Cheſtnut trées to defende themſelues againſt the inſulting horſemen, ouerwhelmed their enimies with a great tempeſt of ſmall ſhatte. By them (as it was afterwarde knowne) who were in number almoſt fiue hundreth, was the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſlayne, when he haſtred with the men of armes to be preſent at the fight. Neyther was he ſtreyght way known being ſpéedily ſpoyled of his coate of cloth of ſiluer, and his guilte armour. They ſaye that before he was wounded, he foughte or horſebacke, hande to bande with <hi>Nicolas Maſio</hi> the Gréeke, who battered his heade péece with a Mall of pron, and <hi>Orange</hi> often aſſayed to thruſte him through with his ſworde. But <hi>Maſio</hi> fearing the ſhocke of the men of armes, fledde backe vnto the Cheſtnut trées, but the Prince, preſſing forth ouer hardily, receyued two deadlye woundes by barquebuſſe. Almoſte at the verye ſame time <hi>Vitelli</hi> charging ouerthwarte the rerewarde, which <hi>Paolo de Cere</hi> ledde, did ſo breake their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raye, and ſcatter them almoſte at the firſt encounter, that hée gotte all their enſignes: although that <hi>Paule</hi> himſelfe valiantly reſiſted; and lighting on foote, repayred the araye of his men, and alſo renuing the fight, brake throughe vnto the towne to ayde <hi>Fernaio.</hi> But when it was bruted abroade that the Prince was ſtayne, and the troupe of the men of armes (a thinge ſhamefull to ſée, and incredible to hée reported) was fledde backe headlong: <hi>Fernaio</hi> crying victorie, victorie, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Florentines</hi> cloſe togither, and beganne to preſſe on the appalled Emperialles.

So then firſt the vpper campe, where <hi>Peren</hi> had lodged, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the bandes of the Captaine of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and <hi>Valentine,</hi> and the <hi>Almaines</hi> were driuen downe with headlong flighte from all the hill of Saint <hi>Gerarde.</hi> Neyther doe they in <hi>Ofen</hi> let ſlippe this good occaſion offered to interclude their enimies, but incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſallyed out at the gate of the water toure, and at that gate of the Campe that was ouer right againſt them, aſſayled the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which was nowe forſaken, and caſting vpon the ennimies balles of wylde fire, endeuoured to burne the tentes. But <hi>George</hi> the Regent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong King, with as ſodaine as happie deuiſe, did ſet on fire at the Kings ſtables mightie heapes of ſtraw and hey, whereby there ſodenly appeared ſuch a great ſhining flame, that when the <hi>Thonawe</hi> receyued on his brighte water the ſhyning of the light of the fire, and it being ſpred abroade by reuerberation, was caſt forth very like vnto daye light, came vnto the backe of <hi>Peſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:15177:112"/>fléeing fléete, ſo that the veſſels which had bene diſordered, yea, with the vncertaine ſhootes, were nowe ſhot at not only from the water toure, and the caſtell of <hi>Ofen,</hi> but alſo from the <hi>Turkiſhe</hi> campe, and from <hi>Cepellia:</hi> and nowe that ſo greate lighte was brought into all places, <hi>Caſſon</hi> alſo the Admirall of the <hi>Turkiſhe</hi> fléete rowing the lighter veſſels vp the ſtreame, gaue a charge on the ſide of the enimies nauie. So a conflicte by water being alſo attached, our men fought vnfortunately in all places: certayne Hoyes laden with ſouldiours were taken, and manye drowned, and ſunke with the ordiance, all the riuer was filled full of ſlain men, and the wretched companie of Mariners and ſouldiours that laboured to ſwimme to the ſhore. For when the <hi>Ianizars</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the foremoſt bands, had broken into the lower campe, and the reſt of the <hi>Almaines</hi> fleeing into the Iſland by the bridge, were wounded in the backes with Semitarres: they for feare of honeſt death ſought ſhamefull deſtruction in the gulfe of the water. Many were drowned in the déepe chanell, or elſe were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed and thruſt from the ſhipes by the weapons of their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Thrée hundreth veſſelles being that night with incredible conturbation intermedled togither, &amp; for a good while remayning togither, one woulde haue thought there had bene a bridge made ouer the riuer: but <hi>Ferdinandes</hi> Fragates, and the greater Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades diſpairing, got themſelues ſpéedily out of the handes of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and kéeping the enimies from them with their ordinance, ſhotte out at their ſtemmes, went vp the riuer vnto the Iſle of <hi>Comora.</hi> Alſo the armie by lande had the lyke lucke in the campe: but the <hi>Bohemians</hi> manfullye repugning, ended their liues verye honourably, as alſo the bandes of <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Hech,</hi> the chiefe Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell of the footemen, died of wounds receiued in their fore parts: but diuers eſcaping by the top of Saint <hi>Gerardes</hi> hill, when they were come vnto the edge of the cliffe that hanged ouer the camp, darkeneſſe, and feare of their inſtant enimies, confounded their heartes and ſenſes, and ſo they fell downe hedlong from the cliffe, and brake their neckes. But many running out at the principall gate of the campe, met with them of <hi>Ofen,</hi> and exerciſing the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie or crueltie of their enimies, as they were of diuers diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:15177:113"/>ſitions, were eyther ſlayne or ſaued. But when the ſunne ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing did diſcouer the ſlaughter of our men, and the victorie of the <hi>Barbarians:</hi> about thrée thouſande men of all ſortes, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their enſignes at the Churche of Saint <hi>Gerarde,</hi> on the hanger of the hill had ſouldiourlike caſt themſelues into a ring, were ſlain by the enutroning multitude of their enimies: yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the thirde part of them, caſting downe their weapons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to haue their lyues ſaued, and yéelded to be kept for a ſhew more ſhamefull and worſe than death it ſelfe. At the ſame time alſo <hi>Caſson</hi> bringing his victorious nauie vnto the banke of <hi>Peſt,</hi> ſtrake ſuch terror into their heartes that had eſcaped (and might eaſily haue defended the walles) only with their <hi>Turkiſhe</hi> clamors &amp; the thundering of the artillerie, that the horſmen ran ſo faſt out at the gates with fearefull flight, that one of them did hurt another in the througing forth. For the <hi>Almaines</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting their wonted prowes, did ſo tremble at the name of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> that when they ſawe in the Boates the beades wrapped about with lynnen, they ranne a way afrighted and vnarmed, leauing behinde them their plate, and all their deareſt and beſt baggage, with their wagons: yet the <hi>Vſarones</hi> ſtayed a whyle, with whom gréedineſſe of pillage preuayled more than all feare of death, they being buſied in ryfling &amp; ſpoyling of the mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſhops: for a noble and rich Mart of al wares was ſet vp at <hi>Peſt,</hi> Marchantes reſorting out of all partes vnto the ſafe ſeate of the ſtrong and very commodious town for that it was without daunger of the warres, and the tumultes of ſouldiours, and yet neare vnto the campe, there being but a ſhort cut ouer the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer betwéene the towne and the campe. But when no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the walles nor gates, <hi>Caſson</hi> incontinently brake into the towne, and ſlue certain of the ſpoyling <hi>Vſarones,</hi> but he tooke ſuch delight in chriſtian bloude; that he ſpared no man in the towne, no not the ſicke, of whome there was a great number, nor the women that followed the <hi>Almaines,</hi> for they killed all ſorts and ſexes indifferently, vnleſſe it were thoſe whom goodly perſonage and ſtrength had reſerued to be ſlaues, or the floure of tender yeares had purchaſed pardon, for hope of lecherie. So that it is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:15177:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>reported, that there were ſtaine in theſe warres by ſundry chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aboue xx. thouſande Chriſtians. But there were taken in <hi>Peſt,</hi> in the Campe, in the Iſlande, and in the ſhips, that had not yet ben diſcharged, ſixe and thirtie very goodly battering péeces, but of ſmaller mounted on whéeles an hundreth &amp; fiftie. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the enimie got ſuch wonderfull ſtore of gunpowder, &amp; yron ſhot, armour, weapons, and victuals prouided for all the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that by eſtimation of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> that bootie was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted farre the greateſt part of the victorie.

But all the priſaners, who were in number about eyght hundreth, being preſented vnto <hi>Soliman</hi> at his arriuall vnto the campe, were by his commandement all ſlayne; except certaine knowen captaines and noble men, among whom were <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar Pocan,</hi> and <hi>Taske</hi> an olde captaine, maiſter of the watch.</p>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:15177:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>dſo ſet right ouer againſt the middle battell and the <hi>Gaſcoignes,</hi> a whole battallion of <hi>Almaine</hi> footemen (whome he did take to be of inuincible ſtrength) with this order, that in the forefront he placed <hi>Aliprand Madruches</hi> brother vnto the Cardinal of Trent, who had deſired to haue that honor.

He placed all the <hi>Italians</hi> in the left wing, and willed them by little and little to clyme the hill, which roſe vp gently from the ſmall valley, as the better place, and willed them not to ſtirre from thence, leaſt that they ſhoulde be diſordered and defeated by the <hi>Switzers</hi> that ſtoode againſt them, to whome they were inferiour in diſcipline: but to ſtande ſtill in aray and be obedient vnto the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Prince of <hi>Salerne</hi> and <hi>Maſsio,</hi> and vſe their harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes as the chaunce of the battell ſhoulde require. <hi>Philip Lanoy</hi> a Flemming, Prince of <hi>Salmona,</hi> who was Generall of the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) was commaunded to ſtande in the voyde roume betwéene the Lanſquenets and the <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> and <hi>Baleone</hi> did the like, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding directly againſt <hi>Thermes.</hi> But <hi>Charles Conzaga</hi> had a ſpeciall charge to obſerue and inuade <hi>Boutiers,</hi> who ſtoode right ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.

The firſt that ran togither, after that the Marques had giuen the ſignall through the encouragement of his ſouldiours, were the horſemen of <hi>Thermes</hi> and <hi>Baleone,</hi> the which they did with ſo greate valor, that on both ſides many were borne to the grounde, and after their ſtaues were broken, they couragiouſly vſed their battell axes and ſwordes. There <hi>Thermes</hi> charging on the <hi>Italian</hi> footemen, was repulſed, and his horſe being hurte, and falling to the grounde, he was taken by a freſhe water ſouldiour. But although <hi>Baleons</hi> wing of horſemen excelled in prowes, yet they being inferiour in number, coulde not ſuſteyne the force of the French men of armes.

In this ſpéedie, but vncertaine féeſe of victorie, the <hi>Spaniardes</hi> being inflamed, ſo fiercely followed the fléeing Frenchmen, that with continued courſe they did flea and take euen vnto <hi>Carmagnola.</hi> At the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye ſame time the Lanſquenettes who had lyen flatte on the ground that they might auoyde the great ordinance, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Marques, aroſe vp, &amp; taking vp duſt, threw it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their ſhoulders, the which is an olde &amp; religions cuſtome of that nation, thinking by that ceremonie to wynne the fauour of bloudie <hi>Mars,</hi> and then they made towardes the enimie. <hi>Aliprande,</hi> who was in the forefronte of the battallion, goyng certayne paces before the Eſquadron, chalenged to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batte <hi>Monſieur de Molle,</hi> a notorious Captayne on the Frenche ſide.

Thus both the Captaynes falling downe, a verye ſharpe and a bloudie fighte was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne by the foremoſte rankes, where the ſtrengthe of the moſte choſen ſouldiours and petie Captaynes of both armies fought for the dignitie of their name, and for glorious victorie. <hi>Aliprandes</hi> regiment that went forwarde verye hotelye, was more ſlowlye followed by the <hi>Scaligers</hi> than they ſhoulde haue bene, by reaſon of the empeachmente of the lowe and vneuen grounde, whereby neyther coulde their Pykes be borne wyth equall order, nor their rankes be aptlye ſet cloſe togither. But in the hoteſt of the fight, the Emperiall horſemen made into the left wing of the Frenchmen where <hi>Boutiers</hi> ſtoode with his troup readie to fight, and ran forth very couragiouſly, but vainly, &amp; as it appeared anon after, very incommodiouſly and ſhamefullye.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:15177:116"/>whirled themſelues rounde aboute lyke vnto the forme of the Moone, eyther to trayne out the light horſemen from the guarde of the men of armes, or bicauſe they being lighte armed, durſte not aduenture vppon their ennimies, who were all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete armour, or elſe were adduced ſo to doe by an vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpeach vttered (as they ſaide) by <hi>Goit</hi> their Captaine, who commaunded them to turne about their horſes, that they being ouermatched, might not fight with the men of armes by encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring them with their horſes breſt to breſt, and with thick troupe, but with often running vpon them, and incontinentlye reculing backe againe, after the manner of the <hi>Moores.</hi> This vnlooked for turning away of the Emperialles cauſed firſt the Frenchmen to maruayle, and anon after alſo their fellowes aſſuredly to ſuſpecte that they did flée: ſo that <hi>Boutiers</hi> ſodenly with great valor char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the backes of them that turned: who, although that the Marques cried out, and rated them, coulde not be ſtayed, but with headlong courſe ranne vpon the Eſquadron of the <hi>Almains,</hi> and finding it looſe behind the enſignes, opened and brake through all the whole battallion: and alſo the French men following the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, got in too at that breache, and with ſmall adoe ſlue all the foulye diſordered hindermoſt rankes, bicauſe that they were not armed with heade péeces and Coſtelets, as were the fore rankes: the Frenchmen caruing off whole limmes from the vnarmed, with their broade and heauie ſwordes, not vnlike vnto woode kniues that hanged at their ſaddle bowes.

For in this araye a battell cannot ſo eaſtlye bée encloſed, by reaſon of the breadthe thereof, the whiche maye happen with no greate difficultie, if that the Eſquadron bée narrowe. The <hi>Saxon</hi> had ſixe thouſande footemenne caſte into two Eſquadrons, and nyne Cornettes of horſemenne, whiche was two thouſande, ſixe hundreth, and foure ſcore horſemen: but be himſelfe ryding from ranke to ranke, prouided for all neceſſaries in all places.

But when he was admoniſhed by his Marſhall, to go a little on one ſide, that he might more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently vewe them with whome he ſhoulde fight, he ſawe alſo the battell aranged, wherefore vnderſtanding that all the Emperial horſemen were come, and alſo perceyuing their araye and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he returned vnto his hoſte, and determined to take a woode full of Mariſhes, and very blinde narowe pathes, thinking that through the benefite thereof, he ſhoulde be able to prolong the fight vntill it were night, and then he ſhould be ſafely ſhrowded therewith, and commodiouſly recouer <hi>VVittemberg.</hi> But there was betwéene both the armies ſo large an open playne, as wold ſuffice for them to fight in, for it was aboue thrée hundreth paces long: the which playne, the Emperials thought if that they could get, then they ſhoulde defeate their enimies. Wherefore <hi>Alua</hi> ſent the light horſemen before for to impeach the ennimie from taking thereof. But bicauſe that the <hi>Saxon</hi> footemenne and twoo troupes of horſemen ſtoode therevpon, the Emperialles were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire vnto their fellowes, the exployte vnatchieued.

Wherefore they renuing the fight, did ſo vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly giue the charge on their ennimies, that they had almoſte made them to turne their backs. The <hi>Saxon</hi> perceyuing the faint courage of his menne, that he mighte not be enuironed on all partes, and the way of his ſafetie taken from him, called a troup of horſemen from the left wing, and commaunded them to ſuccor their diſtreſſed fellowes, and as the ſhortneſſe of the time would ſuffer, adhorted them in this maner to reteyne the ſtoutneſſe and glorie of their aunceſtors: Vnleſſe that ye your ſelues (fellowe ſouldiours) did verye well knowe that almoſt all mans nobilitie and glorie doth conſiſt in Martiall matters, it woulde haue bene néedefull for me to declare with many words, that our anceſtors

But ſéeing that the ſtraytneſſe of the time doth not beare it, the which doth require fortitude of hart and ſtrength of bodie, than any eloquent ſpeach: This onely thing do I ſay, that at this time we muſt fight for all that we haue: the conſeruation whereof, is repoſed in onely fortitude, and valor of armes. For if we ſhall playe the valiant and ſtoute fellowes, as in déede we ought to doe, this daye will be vnto vs the happieſt day that euer ſhined, and of greateſt memorie among all our poſteritie. For we maye (I doe not ſaye) defende our goodes, countrie, libertie, religion, wiues, children (although that theſe things are of them ſelues moſt deare, and of ſuch price, that for them all perils are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned) neither conſerue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> recouered principality of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> but with ſurpaſſing prayſe and admiration of all forein nations, augment the glorie of the <hi>Germane</hi> name, deliuer from thraldom, and make frée the <hi>Almaine</hi> Empire, and feare the reſt of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Germaines</hi> from euer againe vexing of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and finally obteyne a glorious and quiet peace for euer. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, if we giue place to fortune, who is moſtlye frende vnto the hardie, but ſeldome vnto the fearefull, we muſt néedes come into the hands of our enimies with extreame ſhame, and at one time léeſe all that we haue, &amp; poſſeſſe. By theſe reaſons were the <hi>Saxons</hi> a litle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, who being ſet in ſuch aray as was thought beſt for that preſent, the Duke himſelfe ſtoode with his horſemen before his footmen, that they might be confirmed. For he did not a litle diſtruſt their prowes. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right wing againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperials he placed <hi>Erneſt</hi> the Duke of <hi>Brunſwicke</hi> with the horſmen of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Bernarde,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Segherne,</hi> whome he did take to be his beſt. He gaue order, that if the Emperials did giue any charge in their battels, they ſhoulde ſhoote off all their Piſtolets and harquebuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at once, and alwayes kéeping their aray, ſuffer the inuaſions of their enimies, and alſo commaunded that no man on payne of death ſhoulde go out of his place, for he himſelfe woulde be carefull to bring them ſuccour: and thus they faire and ſoftlye expected the onſet of the Emperialles. The <hi>Saxon</hi> himſelfe roade
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:15177:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>hither and thither, opportunelye prouiding and ſéeing to all things: then he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the horſemen and certaine harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers to giue a charge vpon the Emperiall light horſemen, that the reſt of his footemen might the more commodiouſlye get into the woode, through whoſe garde they thought they ſhoulde be ſafe. But by this time had the Emperour ioyned with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantgarde of his men, and with fewe words adhorted his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours to attache the battell, crying Saint <hi>George, Hiſpaine,</hi> and the Empyre. But when all the Emperiall troupes ran forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither equally fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, they came vnto a dirtie plot, where many of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſes did ſlyde, as in a ſlipperie place: wherfore the battell was forced to ſtaye vntill that the fore warde were paſſed the ſlough leaſt that elſe both battels ſhould be diſordered, and one intermired with another, whereby it came to paſſe, that they going aſide, the auantgard was paſſed by at that ſame time that the <hi>Saxons</hi> gaue the charge that I ſpake of with very good order, on the lyghte horſemen of the Emperialles. When that the Emperour ſawe this oportunitie to haue a ſayre daye, he ſente from the one ſide men of armes, and from the other the harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers on horſebacke, and Duke <hi>Morrice</hi> to charge that parte of the <hi>Saxons</hi> that had before ſéemed to be the more fearfull.

But when that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialles came afterwarde into the woode, they founde ſo manye armours and weapons throwne awaye, and lying on the grounde, and ſo manye ſlayne bodyes heaped in the wayes, that it was a lamentable ſight vnto their countrimen, ſome ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their berthren, other their couſins and frendes ſlaine by them, and alſo it was no ſmall impediment vnto the reſt to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the chace.

For euen there wyth good courage taking their leaues of the Counſell, my Lorde Marſhall requiring only that if it went not well with him, my Lordes grace woulde be good to his wife and children, he ſayde he woulde méete the Scottes, and ſo with their bandes theſe Captaynes tooke their way towardes the enimie. By this were our fore warde and theirs within two flyght ſhottes a ſunder. The Scottes baſted with ſo faſt a pace, that it was thought of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:15177:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>the moſt part of vs they were rather horſemen than footemen: Our men againe were ledde the more with ſpéede.

But the Scottes in the middes of their ſwifte marche, were all at a ſodaine ſtaye, and ſtoode ſtill a good while (the cauſe whereof is vncertaine) and then made haſtily towardes vs againe. I know not (to ſaye the truth) whether more ſtoutlye of courage, or more ſtrongly of order, me thought then I might note both in their march. But what after I learned ſpecially touching their order, their armour, and their maner of fight, as well in going to offende, as in ſtanding to defende, I haue thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie here to vtter.

My Lorde Marſhall notwithſtanding, whom no daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger detracted from doing of his enterpriſe, with the company and order afore appointed, came full in their faces from the hylles ſide, with preſent mynde and courage continuing their courſe towarde the enimie. And my Lordes grace alſo at his place fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly tempeſted aloft with the ordinance. The enimies were in a fallowe fielde, whereof the furrowes laye ſideling towarde our men: By the ſide of the ſame furrowes next vs, and a ſtones caſt from them, was there a croſſedich, or ſlough, which our men muſt néedes paſſe to come to them, wherein many that could not leape ouer, ſtacke faſt, to no ſmall daunger of themſelues, and ſome diſorder of their fellowes. The ennimies perceyuing our men faſt approch, diſpoſed themſelues to abide the brunt, and in this order ſtoode ſtill to receyue them. The Earle of <hi>Anguiſh</hi> next vs in the forewarde, as Captaine of the ſame with an eight thouſande, and foure or fiue péeces of ordinance on his right ſide, and foure hundreth horſemen on his left: behinde him ſomewhat weſtward, the Gouernour, with x.

That notwithſtanding, and though alſo they were nothing likely wel to be able thus a front to come within them to hurt them, as well bicauſe the Scottiſhe mens pykes were as long, or longer than their ſtaues, as alſo for that their horſes were all naked without bardes, whereof thoughe there were right many among vs, yet not one put on, foraſmuch as at our comming forth in the morning, we looked for nothing leſſe than for battell that daye, yet did my Lorde and <hi>Shelley</hi> with the reſidue, ſo valiantly and ſtrongly giue the charge vpon them, that whether it were by their prowes, or power, the lefte ſide of the enimies that his Lordſhippe did ſet vpon (though their order remained vnbroken) yet was compelled to ſwaye a good waye backe, and gyue grounde largely, and all the reſidue of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to ſtande much amaſed. Before this, as our men were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie at them, they ſtoode very braue and bragging, ſhaking their Pyke poyntes, crying, come here Loundes, come here Tykes, come here Heretikes, and ſuch like opprobrious wordes: Our Captaines that were behinde, perceyuing at eye, that both by the vneuenneſſe of the grounde, by the ſturdie order of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and for that their fellowes were ſo nie, and ſtreight before them, they were not able to any aduauntage to maintaine this onſet: did therefore according to the deuiſe in that poynt appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, turne themſelues, and made a ſoft retire vp towarde the hill againe.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:15177:128"/>hundreth ſlaine on the French ſide: and of the Emperials aboue foure hundreth. But when both armies had long lodged verye neare one vnto another, they were in great diſtreſſe for water, for the which they muſt continuallye fight when eyther men or horſes néeded it.

And like kind of liberall promiſes did <hi>Strozzi</hi> alſo cauſe to be publiſhed. On the firſt of Auguſt they ſkirmiſhed againe, in the which conflict both the horſemen and the footemen of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials hauing the better, ſtrake no ſmall terror into the heartes of the Frenchmen. But when <hi>Strozzi</hi> ſawe that by the <hi>Italians</hi> their ſlyding away from him, he was brought to weake for his enimie, he went about by little and little to withdrawe his hoſte out of daunger, ſending his cariages and ordinance before: but yet ſo, that he woulde not only not ſéeme to fléee, but alſo of his owne accorde to offer the battell vnto his enimies, the whiche yet he thought he ſhoulde auoyde, bicauſe it was ſo neare night. But his counſels being knowne of the Emperials, were infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by them, for they incontinently followed him in aray of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and light harquebuſiers were ſent before to haggle on the backes and tayle of the Frenchmen, and to hinder their marche vntill that the Emperiall horſemen coulde ouertake them, who were gone forth vnto the riuer of <hi>Thiane</hi> for water. The Marques egerly purſuing and following <hi>Strozzi,</hi> thus ordered his armie: He did caſt the <hi>Almaines</hi> into a ſquare battell, placing the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes</hi> vnder the conducte of <hi>Iohn de Luna</hi> in the left wing, and the <hi>Italians</hi> in the right. But the Earle of <hi>San Fioria</hi> ſtoode with all the Horſmen on the left ſide at the foote of the hill called Womens hill, ouer right againſt the French horſemen. But thus were
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:15177:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>the French battels aranged: A thick battallion of <hi>Italian</hi> foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtoode vpon the Womens hil directly againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> an other of <hi>Gaſcognes</hi> and Frenchmen, and a thirde of <hi>Switzers,</hi> the horſemen were ſette oppoſite to the Emperiall horſemen, and were guarded with ſeauen hundreth harquebuſiers. <hi>Strozzi</hi> had before him <hi>Martiano,</hi> behinde him <hi>Luciano,</hi> on his lefte hande <hi>Fogliano,</hi> and on his right diuers other townes. When both the armies ſtoode thus aranged in order of battell, and the Marques was doubtfull whether he ſhoulde trye the fortune of the battell that daye or no, he was impelled through many reaſons, and ſpecially by the <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to fighte: wherefore after he had giuen the ſignall, he gotte him vnto the rerewarde. For ſéeing hée foughte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte agaynſte his will, hée thought if that anye yll lucke happened, hée woulde prouyde for hys owne ſafetye: but if that all thinges ſuccéeded well, then he woulde encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his ſouldiours to folowe the victorie. As ſoone as the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the battell was giuen, the Conte of <hi>San Fiora</hi> paſſing ouer a ditche that ranne along the playne, gaue the charge on the Frenche horſemen, who were all ledde by the Earle of <hi>Mirandula.</hi> They fighte fiercelye on both ſides, but the French men being inferiour in number, and alſo ouermatched by reaſon of the ſtrength of the menne of armes, althoughe they were garded with harquebuſiers, were put to ſlighte and defeated, the which happened, bicauſe that <hi>Bighet</hi> fledde with the chiefe guydon as ſoone as euer the enimie gaue the onſette. When thys had happened ſooner than coulde be credited, <hi>San Fiora</hi> fearing that there was ſome ambuſhe layde, woulde not at the firſte ſuffer his horſemenne to purſue his fléeing enimies, as the reaſon of the victorie required. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde when he certainelye vnderſtoode that it was a true ſlyght and not a feygned, he graunted his horſemenne leaue to followe the enimie in chaſe, whiche when <hi>Strozzi</hi> ſawe, he vtterly caſting awaye all hope of the horſemenne, and their repayring of the fight, ſéeing that the purſuing of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialles woulde graunte them no place to ſtrengthen their
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:15177:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>courſe, and to ſtaye and ſtande, and vnderſtanding that hée ſhoulde be enuironed rounde aboute on all partes, if he dyd come downe into the playne, but on the other ſide, if that hée ſtoode ſtill on the hill, he ſhoulde be verye greatly annoyed by the ordinaunce of the enimies, and beſieged, he of neceſſitie determined to aduenture a pitched fielde. And bicauſe the ſtreightneſſe of the place did ſo require, he reduced his thrée battels into one battell, for that at neyther ſide there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye vſe of harquebuſiers, who had in their often ſkirmiſhes ſpent all their pouder, and emptied their flaſkes. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials ſtanding ſtill, expected the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming &amp; charge of the French men, and namelye ſéeing the Frenche footemen and <hi>Switzers</hi> came forwarde verye luſtilye and couragiouſlye, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialles vſed the benefit of a good déepe ditche that ranne croſſe the playne, neare vnto the banke whereof, they placed their foremoſte rankes: for it was iudged that they which ſhoulde firſte paſſe ouer the ditche, woulde come into great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and giue an eaſie victorie vnto their enimie, by reaſon of the going downe and climbing vp againe of the ditch. Now ſéeing that matters of verye great importance are ſette before wyſe Chiefetaynes, as the glorie of their armies, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, the ſafetie of their ſubiectes, and all humane felicitie, they oughte to be moſte circumſpecte in all things that doe appertayne vnto their honour, and the ſafetie of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to prouyde and foreſée that thoſe things whiche are profitable and good for them, if that they cannot gette them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yet then at the leaſt to be ſure that they ſuffer not their ennimie to haue them, bicauſe that the commodities of the ennimie, doe redounde vnto their calamities. For the whiche effecte, the natures and diſpoſitions bothe of hys owne ſouldiours, and of the ennimies are to be knowen, their counſayles and deuyſes to be learned oute, their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and martiall furniture to be vnderſtoode, and their arte in ſetting their men in araye, and the nature of the place muſte be viewed: of the whiche things if that anye one be not well knowen, or neglected, oftentimes it bryngeth all the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:15177:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>whole ſtate into verye great daunger. For there is nothing ſo perillous as an hoſte aranged in battel againſt the nimie, for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light matter, yea and a very ſmall and vaine falſe rumour may make them to turne their backes, and flée. But to returne vnto the battell, the Frenchmen as they are of nature prone to fighte, and readie to aduenture all warrelike daungers to winne glorie: being nothing at all ſtayed with the difficultie of the ditche, goe downe into it for to giue the onſet on the Emperials. The auant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, and ſpecially the foremoſt rankes which conſiſted of the moſt choſen bandes of the whole armie, was put to flight. The difficultie of this ditch tooke the victorie almoſt out of the handes of the Frenchmen, and gaue it without bloude vnto the Emperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: although that the Frenchmen charging the Emperiall <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> had defeated the left wing. Then the Marques fearing leaſt that all his battels would haue the like yll hap, mounting on his horſe, got him vnto an hill on the backe of all the hoſte, where he might ſée in what ſtate his armie ſtoode. But anon after when he ſawe the French battell that had diſcomfited his left wing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encloſed rounde by the <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> the <hi>Almaines,</hi> and the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> to be defeated, and chiefly through the valor of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes,</hi> who fought worthily that daye, he returned againe vnto his men, to incite them to fight. Thus the moſt flouriſhing armie of <hi>Strozzi,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which a litle before was a terror vnto all <hi>Tuſcan,</hi> the which houered ouer the walles of the citie of <hi>Florence,</hi> the which threatened ſlaughter, captiuitie and fire vnto all the townes of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Duchie, was in ſhorte time ouerthrowen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the <hi>Italians</hi> fléeing, and the horſemen being diſcomfited, afflicted, and put to flight through that ditche, whereby it maye plainly appeare in howe ſlipper a place mannes ſtate ſtandeth, which is ſubiect vnto frayle and fickle Fortunes pleaſure.

Behinde the light horſemen followed &amp; troupe of <hi>Reyſters</hi> with Piſtolets, and then a troupe of men of armes of the lowe Countrimen, a certaine ſpace being left betwéene eyther of the battels. Then were all the footemen deuided into thrée hattels: the footemen were high <hi>Almaines, Nederlanders,</hi> whoſe regiment was greateſt, and certaine bandes of old <hi>Spaniſhe</hi> footemen: they were led by their Colonels, <hi>Hilmaner</hi> of <hi>Mumchauſen, Binicourt,</hi> and <hi>Caruatal</hi> The armie being thus aranged, <hi>Egmont</hi> cried out with a loude voyce, we haue vanquiſhed: All that haue regarde of their owne prayſe, or the glorie of their countrie, let him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe me, and ſetting their ſpurres vnto their horſes, runne in with me among the thickeſt of our enimies.

Thus they fought verye ſharply a long and doubtfull battell.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:15177:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>was ſo great, that they ſupplied the others daſtardie, &amp; with their ſtrength ſuſteyned almoſt all the brunt and force of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: for the Lanſquenets ſtanding ſtill, as it were men ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them, and left a certaine ſpace of, the <hi>Gaſcons</hi> flewe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the vrging <hi>Burgonions,</hi> they reſiſted them, and with haughtie heartes receyued their anpreſſion.

Moreouer, whyle that they fought ſo valiantly, and with ſo great contention of heartes, that neyther partie woulde turne their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, a ſtraunge &amp; marueylous chaunce happened: for at the ſame time ten Engliſhe ſhippes chaunced to ſayle by, who deſcrying the encounter when they were in the maine ſea, made towarde them, and it being full ſea, came neare vnto the ſhore, and with their ordinance did beate the ſide of the French armie, the which we ſolde you before, lay full vpon the ſea.

Two thirdes of the Catholike horſemen were companies of men of armes and the ordinances of his maieſtie. Fewe light horſes, and no harquebuſiers on horſebacke at all. The men of armes (which were the two thirdes of all the horſemen) were mounted and armed to the aduantage, the men in complete har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and their horſes all barded, and caparaconned with chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſraines, and the horſemen in ſteade of little Piſtolets many bare with their Launce a Piſtole, and ſome a maſſe of armes, but moſt were onely Launces. The light horſemen were well horſed, and wore on their heade a Sallet, Bourguignomie, or other ſuche habilliment, with a Cairaſſe hauſe, colbracates, long taſſettes, Gantlets, and a caſe of Piſtolets at the Pummell of his Saddle, with a tocke or Coutelas hanging at his ſide. The enfignes and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:15177:139"/>guidons of the men of armes were charged with croſſes, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were the enſignes of the footemen, to make a diuerſitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them and thoſe of the Proteſtants. The footemen were deuided into thrée groſſe battallions (except thoſe harquebuſiers which reſted at the Chappell, and thoſe that flanked certayne companies, which made the left of the Conſtable) who mighte amount vnto fiftene or ſixtene thouſande men. One battallion was of ſixe thouſande <hi>Switzers,</hi> Pykemen, whoſe thicke and cloſe hedge doth well dare to abyde the ſhocke of the ſtrongeſt horſemen of the worlde, except the furie of the men of armes of Fraunce, armed and barded as aforeſayde, who haue often ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes broken and defeated them.

Their white croſſe diſtinguiſhed them from the Proteſtants, and they namely thoſe that were light armed as harquebuſiers, wore a mandile, or ſuch another habite marked with a number of white croſſes, that they might not be taken for the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. But the Proteſtants had not aboue halfe their armie at <hi>Saint Denys,</hi> for <hi>Dandelot</hi> and <hi>Montgommerie</hi> were ſent to take <hi>Poiſſy</hi> and <hi>Ponthoiſe, la Nouè</hi> to take <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Conte <hi>de la Rochfoucault</hi> and <hi>Mouye</hi> were gone againſte the troupes that were leuied for them in <hi>Guien</hi> and <hi>Poitou,</hi> to ſafe conducte them to the Campe: all which things being knowne vnto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, made him to haſte that he myghte take the profite of this aduauntage. But of the fouretene or ſixtene hundreth horſemen of the Proteſtantes, not one was armed with all péeces, both bicauſe they diſlodged haſtilye at the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prince, as alſo for the weakeneſſe of their horſes, who were almoſt all Curtalles, and ſuche like baſe horſes, ſo that there was not one harded or caparaconned, but they were armed like light horſemen, the two thirdes of them hauing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

The Caſſockes of the Proteſtantes were white, begarded with ſuch colours, as the deuiſe of the Captaine did demaund. All their footemen were harquebuſiers well inough furniſhed, the third part of whom had a Morion for all their defence, with a white ſcarfe for to diſcerne them from the Catholikes: they alſo had their Enſignes of diuers colours beguarded with the deuiſe of the Captaine, in lieu of a croſſe which the Catholikes bore. Now I come to declare the intents and purpoſes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Chieftaines of the armies. The Conſtable ſeeing the ſmall nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the yll aſſured lodging of the Proteſtantes, reſolued to fight with them. And bicauſe he ſawe that <hi>Saint Ouin</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beruilliers</hi> were the defences of <hi>Saint Denys,</hi> not once thinking that the confederates woulde be ſo bolde as to come into the fielde, conſidering their ſmall number, and to make heade vnto ſo great an army as followed him, and ſpecially ſéeing that they had not one Canon (bicauſe that ſince they tooke the fielde, they had not anye towne that coulde furniſhe them) determined to driue the Proteſtantes out of thoſe two villages into <hi>Saint De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys,</hi> and there to beſiege them, and make them yéelde at hys pleaſure. In verye déede the Proteſtantes woulde rather haue refuſed (if they had bene aſſured of their comming) than haue accepted the battell: but bicauſe they had intelligence but in the morning, that the footemenne were iſſued out of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and that the Conſtable was reſolued to diſlodge, neceſſitie to ſaye the truth more than good will, broughte them to the fighte, the which they woulde haue preſented, if that <hi>Dandelot</hi> and <hi>Montgommerie</hi> had bene there with their bandes, who then laye before <hi>Poiſſy,</hi> yet neuertheleſſe they were reſolued in no caſe to gyue the charge before it were towardes the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if it coulde be poſſible, both as well for to couer and the better to fauour their retraite, if they ſhoulde be purſued, as alſo by ſo doing, to take awaye from the Catholykes the felicitie of an entier victory and iourney: and finally that in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:15177:140"/>the meane time <hi>Dandelot</hi> who had bene ſent for, might haſte with all diligence to be there in time. Vpon this generall reſolution the Conſtable iſſued out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and leauing the Chappell, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſent a good number of harquebuſiers, marched with his armie ſtreyght vnto the villette, for to ſtretche out his armie in length for to take the commoditie of the field, and to ſtande more like vnto an hedge, than any thing elſe. On the left ſide where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he did ſet the battallion of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> flanked with a good number of Frenche harquebuſiers, and all theſe ſtoode for to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure fouretene péeces of artillerie which he had placed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of <hi>Auberuilliers,</hi> towarde the which he made the moſt part of his armie to turne heade: he encamped a regiment of horſemen on the left ſide of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and did ſet before them one greate troupe of horſemen, as it were to couer them, the Captaine of the which troupe was Mareſchall <hi>Montmorencie</hi> his eldeſt ſonne. He had on his lefte ſide the regimentes and companies of the Dukes of <hi>Nemours, Longueuille,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Conte <hi>de Rez, Chauignie, de Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ree, Lanſac,</hi> and many other: cloſe to the whiche companies ſtoode one good troupe of harquebuſiers on foote. Behinde thoſe horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and towardes the Chappell was the regiment of footemen of the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> who did all gliſter almoſt with armour, Pykes, and Halbardes, and did hide the left ſide of the armie Catholike, the middle and the principall force whereof did the <hi>Switzers</hi> and the Conſtable make. On the right ſide of the <hi>Switzers</hi> were the regiments of the Conte <hi>Briſſac,</hi> and <hi>Strozzi</hi> On the right ſide more higher, did the companies of the Mareſchall <hi>Coſſé, Biron,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Vicont <hi>de Auchy, la Riuiere,</hi> and diuers other which ſtoode more neare to <hi>Auberuilliers,</hi> ſhewed themſelues: behinde whome more lowe than the villet or ſmall towne, ſtoode the Duke <hi>de Aumaule,</hi> and Mareſchall <hi>de Anuille,</hi> aſſiſted on both ſides with two troupes of horſmen, as it were for the aſſurance of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> &amp; the French footmen. But now we will ſhew the diſpoſition of the armie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant. When that the Prince had intelligence vpon a ſodayne, that the Catholikes were iſſued out of <hi>Paris,</hi> drawing with them the artillerie, he well knewe that the daye woulde not paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fight. And therefore all the companies being aduertiſed, came
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:15177:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>into the fielde, being fully reſolued for to accept the fight if they were forced, although that their fellowes were not come, and ſtretched out themſelues (which thing only reſted for them to do) in this forme. As their armie had bene deuided before that time into thrée partes, ſo they nowe alſo made thrée troupes. The Admiral being aſſiſted with <hi>Clermont</hi> of <hi>Ambois,</hi> his two ſonnes, <hi>Renty,</hi> and ſix cornets of horſemen, and with foure hundreth har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers on foote, who followed the horſemen, and were led by <hi>Valefeniere,</hi> placed himſelfe aboue <hi>Saint Ouin,</hi> as it were for to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and defende his lodging right in the face of thoſe that garded the ſide of the Conſtable. To the ſame ende <hi>Ienlis</hi> being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Lauardin, Vardes, Breſſant, Beſancourt,</hi> &amp; v. or vj. cornets whom thrée hundreth footmen harquebuſiers folowed for to helpe them at the pricke of the charge, made the other horne, and the forme of a left auantgarde, before his lodging at <hi>Auberuilliers,</hi> (againſt the whiche they ſawe that the Catholikes had made heade, and bent the greateſt force of their armie) directly againſt <hi>Biron</hi> and the reſt before mentioned. To preuayle the better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whome, they had made a ditche from <hi>Auberuilliers,</hi> euen vnto a Windmill, which is betwéene the village, and the villet, the which ditch, and the Windmill it ſelfe, they had filled with manye of the beſte harquebuſiers that they had, for to ſalute them that woulde come to ſéeke them. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Cardinall of <hi>Chaſtillon, Sechelles,</hi> (who vnder title of Lieutenant conducted the companie of the Duke of <hi>Angieu</hi>) with the two <hi>Vidames</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> and of <hi>Amiens,</hi> the Contes of <hi>Saux,</hi> and of <hi>la Suze,</hi> of <hi>Esternay, Brouchauanes,</hi> and <hi>Stuart</hi> accompanied with certaine Scots, with foure hundreth harquebuſiers, ſtoode lower informe of the battayle couering <hi>Saint Denys,</hi> and all that runne behinde the croſſe which is vpon the cauſey, and the Chappell of <hi>Landet,</hi> right in the face of the Conſtable, and of them that were before him: All the Cornettes ſtoode along in a rowe lyke vnto an hedge, and their horſes were ranged front to front, in ſuch forme as they ment to fight. The cauſe of this aray (it may be ſo) was lacke of men to make an entier battallion, or bicauſe it is moſt ordinarie among the Frenchmen, who vſe the Launce:
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:15177:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>or to thende they might charge altogither, and not one tarye behinde an other as moſt doe in battallions. The footemen were deuided into thrée troupes, as they were before, and they cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no enſignes, but being all harquebuſiers, they ſerued for <hi>Enfans perdus,</hi> who as the moſt aſſured and reſolute to fighte, doe beare death engrauen vpon their foreheades, as well for themſelues, as for thoſe that they firſt attach. Theſe harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers followed good and neare vnto the horſemen, but when it came vnto the poynt that they ſhoulde go vnto the charge, they ſhoulde aduaunce themſelues forth before vpon the ſides for to ſhoote right and with aſſurance vpon the firſt of the Catholikes, that would ioyne with the Proteſtants, as you ſhall heare. So that the diſpoſition of their armie was in the forme of a Moone, more than of any thing elſe, if that their companies had bene ioyned togither, &amp; had ſtoode nearer and cloſer one vnto another. But as I told you before, they were deuided into thrée parts, of whom the troupes of the Admiral and <hi>Ienlis</hi> made as it were the two hornes of the Croiſant, whereof the battell of the Prince made the but or bottome, and the middes was ſtronger than the endes, who not hauing ſo many Launces &amp; horſmen were more cleare, thin, and leſſe furniſhed of men. They had all their forces in the fielde, for thinking that none coulde come vnto <hi>S. Denys,</hi> but that they muſte firſte defeate them who couered their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, they left none there, but their Pikemen and Holbarders, who not being inowe in number, and ſufficient for to make a battallion of Pykes in that playne, they would haue to remaine in the towne for to garde the baggage, and the Enſignes of the harquebuſiers. Neyther was it long before that a ſkirmiſh was attached on the ſide of <hi>Auberuilliers.</hi> The artillerie beganne to thunder, and was ſhot off foure <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o ſhoote right on the battel, this is it that makes <hi>Ienlis</hi> (when he
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:15177:141"/>ſaw that the light attaches waxed ſtill hoter and hoter, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed euery moment, fearing that the Catholikes would not charge his troups in groſſe (to go vnto the Prince to demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of him if he were not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduiſe that he might charge according to the occaſion &amp; eſtate of the ſkirmiſhe. But as he returned with permiſſion to do it, he ſawe that <hi>Vardes</hi> was in fight. For the chiefe Captaine ſéeing that the Catholikes augmented their number vpon the ſkirmiſhers, had no ſooner made them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, but that two companies marched for to ouerrunne them. Then was he conſtrayned to take part, to range and cloſe togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his men as well as he coulde, and hauing deſired them not to breake their araye, and to charge with might and mayne, and to enterſuccour one another, he auaunced apace for to receyue the Catholikes, who chaunging their pace into a trot, reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred them with ſuch furie, that the moſt aſſured made their Launces to flée into ſhiuers, the other that coulde not aſſigne ſo right, péerced the bodies of the horſes: all in generall came vnto the Piſtoles and Coutelas, which haſted death to aboue fiftie in that firſt charge, and there were a good many moe hurt that fought not after, namely by reaſon of the pellets which the harquebuſiers that were in the trench made to rayne vpon them that firſt came to attach <hi>Vardes,</hi> who perceyuing that he ſhoulde not be long able by reaſon of his ſmall number to ſtande vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the Catholikes that came to renforce their firſt men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired by little and little for to rallye his men with the helpe of the ditche, out of the which came ſuch a ſtrong <hi>ſalué</hi> of harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes, that many made conſcience for to approche neare vnto it.

The firſt charge of <hi>Ienlis</hi> was more cruell than the ſeconde, although that the leaſt of the thrée was verye bloudie for the death of many braue gentlemen that neuer after ſtrake blowe with the ſworde. But this is true, that neyther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate deſperateneſſe, nor the helpe of the harquebuſiers coulde haue ſure warranted them to ſtande vp long, ſéeing that the moſt of the forces Catholike turned into that quarter, if that the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall charges of the Prince and the Admirall had not made manye to turne tayle, whileſt that <hi>Ienlis</hi> and manye of his companions entertayned the fight againſt the hoteſt of the Catholikes, giuing leyſure vnto them that were moſt wearied with ſo long and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a fight, to remayne quiet, and aranged in battell, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace themſelues for the firſt occaſion that ſhoulde preſent it ſelfe vnto them.

You haue ſéene the good meane that the Catholikes had to preuayle with their artillerie, and howe it ſerued them. During the time of this great thunder, the Captaines of both armies waited for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of their charge, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of the Generals, namely the confederates, who

               </gap>ching diuelrie, which vomited ſo many curſes vpon them, ſometime to high, and oftentimes more lowe than the gunners thought, but alwayes doing leſſe hurte than the Generall Catholike deſired. Herevpon the Admirall had no ſooner founde his aduauntage, but that he ſent to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the Prince of all that he had marked concerning the ſtate of the Catholikes, who ſtayed not long after to followe him. The Conte of <hi>Colignie</hi> made his harquebuſiers to haſten their pace, and hauing made them to aduaunce themſelues on his ſide, they ſerued him to ſo great purpoſe, that the reencou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter was through them much the more fortunate vnto him. At the ſame inſtant he ſo luſtily charged the red Coates, and thoſe troupes that were neare vnto them on the left ſide (who had come to ſéeke him) that they were not able long time to ſuſteyne the furious purſuite, and were in the ende chaced euen vnto the Chappell. Thoſe men that haue flight more naturall and ordinarie than reſolution in ſuch affaires, canaſſure you, that troupes broken and hotly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, haue no diſcretion and conſideration of the places through which they paſſe for to ſaue the priſon of the ſoule. This cauſed the greateſt part of them to make waye with the force of their horſes (who had their ſides ſcorched) through the <hi>Pariſian</hi> bandes, whome they very much brake, and alſo much more affrighted, ſo that they were not able long time after to reaſſure them oute of the trembling &amp; feare of <hi>Saint Denys.</hi> And not onelye the footemen were diſcouraged, but alſo many of the braue horſmen had aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the number of the other companies. Vpon this the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchall <hi>Coſſé</hi> ſéeing thoſe of <hi>Ienlis</hi> his regiment to retire by little and little (after that he had appoynted certaine companies for to make heade if they woulde begin agayne) made all the reſt of his troupes to turne directlye towardes the encounter, whereof we nowe come to ſpeake, ſending one to deſire the Mareſchall <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Aumalle,</hi> to follow him to the charge which he went to giue (the which they promiſed him to doe) and ſomuch the more, for that he ſaw many catholikes ſo afrighted, that they

In another place, and for the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, <hi>Chauignie</hi> aduaunced himſelfe, and wythoute cheape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, gaue into the troupe of <hi>Cleremont,</hi> who bicauſe he had bene ſore hurt at the firſte charge, woulde not ſuſteyne the ſhocke, but retired with a great pace from that charge, whiche was mortall to many of the Conſederates. Although that I can not expreſſe vnto you but one feate of armes at once, yet imagine you that all the troupes, or at the leaſt two thirdes of them were at one tyme encountering togither to the ruine of the weaker, and the leſſe happye: thinke you that the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were diuers, and that in diuers places manye troupes did charge one another at once. The Prince was that ſame tyme in the myddes of the Catholikes: for as ſoone as he ſawe the Admirall charge, he made his menne to departe with ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that the harquebuſiers that ſhoulde haue aſſiſted him, coulde not followe, nor doe any ſeruice that was of aduantage vnto him. He diſmarching, went directly as it were, for to ioine with the Admirall, that they might both togither charge the Conſtable, and thoſe that made his left ſide, doubting that the Admirall alone was not able to work the effect: but he had not gone farre, but that the Mareſchall <hi>de Montmorencie</hi> (who coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his father) made all his power to diſmarche to giue him on the ſide, and to put his power to flight, the whiche he had without doubt done, if that certayne which had caſte their eye into that quarter, had not aduertiſed the Prince thereof, who at the ſame inſtant, turned heade vnto all his troupes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them according as the tyme, and the neare being of the Catholikes woulde permit: He the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> the Cardinall of <hi>Chaſtillion,</hi> and many other ranne amayne vpon the Conſtable, while that the reſt of his troupes employed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to make head to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mareſchal <hi>de Montmorencie.</hi> Now, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bicauſe all the troupes of the Prince did not afronte their enimie with equall furie and pertinacie, or (the which I do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beléeue) for that the one were better ſuſteyned than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:15177:143"/>without doubt, the two charges had farre diuers euents, for the Prince marched againſt his part with ſuch violence, that be euerthrowe them, being appalled with the long and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flight of their companions, whome the Admirall had alſo before chaſed, and made ſuch a hole or breach in the great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallion, that the Conſtable being abandoned by aboue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande runne awayes, and finding himſelfe hurt in the face, and encloſed and preſſed to yéelde by <hi>Stuart</hi> a Scot, could not for cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to ſée things frame ſo yll, aunſwere otherwiſe, than with blowes of his ſworde, with the pummell wherof he gaue <hi>Stuart</hi> ſo harde vpon the Iawbones, that he coulde not a long tyme after vſe them with eaſe when hunger preſſed him to moue his téeth (two or thrée of whome leaped out of his mouth, and the reſt were ſore ſhaken and looſed:) then another Scot ſhot his Piſtolet into the Conſtables reynes, bicauſe for féebleneſſe of aboue foureſcore yeares, he had put vpon his backe but only a ſingle &amp; light harneſſe. This would haue afrighted the <hi>Switzers;</hi> thinking that they had bene abandoned by the reſt of all the horſemen, of whome they ſawe a great part already diſmayed, and manye to retire with a great gallop, thinking that all was loſte (to the foremoſte and moſte hardie of whome, the gates of <hi>Paris</hi> ſéemed not neare ynoughe,) if that the Duke of <hi>Aumalle,</hi> Mareſchall <hi>de Anuille,</hi> and certayne other had not reaſſured them, proteſting that they woulde dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that anye other euill ſhoulde happen vnto them, than the feare that they had alreadye conceyued. Wherewyth they were no leſſe contented, than ioyfull for the well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Mareſchall <hi>de Montmorencie,</hi> who hauing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle whyle encountred with equall and incertayne ſhocke, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the Princes troupes, in the ende layde the moſte aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and beſt of them on the grounde, making the reſte to flée, who broughte a greate feare vnto all their footemenne; namelye, to thoſe of the Admirall, and the Prince, who bicauſe they had followed them but a little waye, marched for to intertayne ſhirmiſhe with the footemenne Catholikes: but they, who otherwyſe woulde not haue bene made to feare,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:15177:144"/>being reencountred by their fléeing friendes, were entierlye and wholy broken, the horſes ranne ouer manye of their bellies, who founde themſelues verye much offended and gréeued with thys iourney. After this was done, euery troupe drewe into that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where he hearde the plaintes of his Generall: for in a verye little moment euery one leauing the aduantage that he thought he had, turned face: the Catholikes to the cries of the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Proteſtantes to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who playned of his horſe, who hauing his ſides trauerſed with a Launce, and being hurt with diuers pellets, began to founder vnder him.</p>
            <p>By theſe meanes the place of conflict was by little and little, and within ſhort moment quite abandoned by the fighters, aſwel for the hurt happened vnto both the two Generalles, as alſo bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they all ſawe that the daye declined, and was come vnto his ende, ſo that the browne of the night did greatly inuite them to retire. The Prince was no ſooner lighted off from his horſe, but that he fell downe at his féete ſtarke deade. The Admirall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the charge, and ſéeing the Catholikes to runne from all partes to ſuccour their Generall, turned towardes the troupe of the Prince, for to rallye and to deliberate vpon the reſt of the iourney. But the night comming while that theſe things were in doing, brought an ende both to the day and the battell, which had endured little lacke of two houres. For the obſcure vale of the darke, and the trauayle of ſo long and hote attaches, did by little and little abate the heate of the moſte couragious, who all in the ende rallyed themſelues vnder their enſignes. Theſe things with the reſt that are many times founde in ſuch encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, do authoriſe me in that which I ſhal ſay (too to ſatiſfie them with one word, that being maiſtred by I cannot tell what blinde paſſion, may thinke that ſuch an ende of the fight betwéene ſuch and ſo vnequall armies, is very ſtraunge) that men reſolute, and deſpairing of retraite, and of all other meanes than the force of their armes, and in ſumme, they that will make a vertue of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, may doe oftentimes farre more than this was.</p>
            <p>When the Proteſtants ſawe that they were not purſued, they conducted the Prince vnto <hi>Saint Denys,</hi> where the counſell aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,

The whiche the captaines did: vpon whom the Catholikes enterpriſed nothing, ſéeming to content themſelues with the remayning maiſters of the fielde, and the diſpoſing at pleaſure of all the fielde for to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie their deade, and to leaue the deſpoyled Proteſtantes, and to ſende the wounded to <hi>Paris.</hi> Thoſe that were appointed to doe it, taried there vntill midnight. The Conſtable was borne backe wounded to death. The Conte <hi>de Chaune, Hierome de Turin,</hi> and mo than fortie other as well Captaines and chiefe, as members of companies left their liues there, whome aboue thrée hundreth other did accompanie, as wel then as afterward, leauing behind them a great multitude of hurt men.

The flight of the footmen was more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the ſlaughter, although that a good many died there, but few of the Catholikes footmen. This battell was fought the x. of Nouember.

            <p>The Duke approched within two leages of <hi>Lodowickes</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and being reſolued vpon his aduertiſements, ſent the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines <hi>Sanchio d' Auila,</hi> and <hi>Montero,</hi> with an hundreth Argolets or harquebuſiers on horſebacke, for to attache the ſkirmiſh, and to traine him out of his fort.

            <p>The Conte who knewe the deliberation of the Duke, that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:15177:147"/>he might hurt &amp; anoy him before that they were come to gripes, ſent a number of footemen and Pioners for to cut vppe and marre the paſſages and wayes, to the ende that the water which was pent vppe, might ouerflowe all the fielde, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme the Dukes armie, ſo that the auantcurrers had not rode long, but that they perceyued the footemen and their gard, who laboured to make a waye for the water. This cauſed the firſt ſkirmiſhe, and the begynning of the iourney. In the ende although the Pioners were forced to retire, yet beyng ſuſteyned ſodainelye by other footemen that were ſent vnto them, they droue the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the place, who ſent vnto their Generall for to demaunde certayne Pykemen and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers, the whiche yet he refuſed to doe, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good conſiderations) he ſawe that according vnto the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that he had ſette in his armye, euerye troupe ſhoulde ſuſteyne and helpe themſelues to their vttermoſt, and as long as they coulde for their liues, ſo that when the foremoſt were preſſed, neceſſitie woulde ſooner ſtirre vp their ſpirites for to inuent ſome good meane, and would ſooner redouble their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for to ſuſteyne the impreſſions and attempts of their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, than if they repoſed themſelues vpon other.) He had alſo fantaſied the lyke at another time and place, when he thought it not good to fight in groſſe with the deſperate, nor to put in the hazarde of one only iourney the entier eſtate of his Prince, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſmall aſſurance that he had in fortune, who doth make hir inconſtancie to be ſéene more in déedes of armes, than anye other thing of the worlde. Wherefore a Generall ought not to fight with his whole power, vnleſſe he be conſtreyned. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, he had his men in ſo carefull regarde, namelye after the blowe receyued at the defeate of <hi>Aremberge,</hi> that he eſtemed more the lyfe of one of them, than the death often enimies. And as one reſolued for all euents, in caſe that he ſhoulde be forced to come to fight, his mynde was through the loſſe of ſome, not only to ſaue the liues of the reſt, but wholy to breake the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, aſſuring himſelfe that if the foremoſt would be ſufficient for to ouerthrowe the enimie, that then their felowes that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:15177:147"/>would make the breach farre greater, but if they being to weake, were broken, then he perſuaded himſelfe that the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie woulde come forth in ſo yll order, and out of aray for to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the victorie, that the reſt of his power would eaſily defeate them. On the other ſide, the Conte <hi>Lodowick</hi> renforced his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and commaunded them to giue in farther, aſſuring them that he woulde alwayes be at their héeles, and not ſuffer them to lacke ſuccours, and in déede they ſo luſtily taſted two or thrée of the foremoſt <hi>Spaniſh</hi> bandes, that the Maiſters of the Campe aduertiſed the Duke that they were loſt, vnleſſe they were ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſuccoured.

As the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Monſieur</hi> was greate in making of the Bridges, ſo was it extreme in paſſing ouer them all the night: on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the Prince (all things being well weyghed) was not willing to reſolue vpon the battell, but commaunded the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall that he ſhoulde cauſe the auantgarde to diſlodge, and he with him at <hi>larnac</hi> vppon the breake of the daye. The whiche was done, but not by all: For the companyes that <hi>Puviant</hi> ledde, coulde not marche ſo ſpéedilye, the whiche was the occaſion that they ſawe the companies of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes at their tayle, and were ſo ſtrongly preſſed by them, that they muſte néedes diſgage and ſuccour them to the perill and diſcomfiture of all the Proteſtantes: for the Chiefe was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by ſo many Catholikes, that be being in the heade of the armie, was in great perill, if that the diſcouerie of the troupes which the Admirall ledde, had not made them that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced neareſt, to ſtaye a little.

            <p>Then they that were leſſe laſie remayned not long withoute ſhirmiſh, namely thoſe that had the hill in their power: for they hauing diſcouered howe ſmall a power the Admirall had, who was nowe retired, came downe and aduaunced themſelues ſo nere, that the Proteſtants could not retire without fight, vnleſſe they would be intierly defeated. So that when ſome and then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholikes came forward, <hi>Puviant</hi> ſaw that he and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments &amp; Cornet was ſo gaged, that if the Lorde <hi>Noré,</hi> and the Lorde <hi>Loué</hi> (to whom the retrait of the auantgarde had bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>But when they had with al their deuoyre ſuccoured them to their great paine, they were forced to defende themſelues with all their power vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bay of a pond, where they were all char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſuch force by <hi>Martigues, Malicorne,</hi> and other, to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this, <hi>Puviant</hi> after he had bene charged, &amp; ſaw that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was to ſmall, retired with the reſt of the footmen.

C. of them aduaunced yet more luſtily, whom the I diniral and <hi>Dandelor</hi> (after they had diſcouered them, and were ignorant of the defeate aforeſaid, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the village was betwéene them) charged <hi>Dandelot</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foremoſt with his Cornet, gaue in ſo furiouſly, that he did put them to ſlight, and hauing purſued them euen into the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage: In his returne be found one of their enſignes, but he was no ſooner out of the village, but that the Catholikes reentred it more ſtrongly than before: for they were followed but a good way off by twelue hundreth harquebuſters, who came to ſeaze on the village. Then he turned vpon them, and made them to retire into the village, where they renforced themſelues with
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:15177:150"/>the footemen, who in their fauour did ſo barre and fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in that place vnto the purpoſe, that it was made impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible afterwarde to chaſe them thence. In the meane tyme all the troupes Catholikes began to ſhewe themſelues, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry regiment did take his place for the battell.</p>
            <p>This was done when that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Admirall (who had ſent vnto him the Baron of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagus</hi>) of the daunger that the auantgarde was in, vnleſſe he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured it, aduaunced himſelfe with thoſe fewe horſemen of hys battell, that he had aſſembled tumultuouſlye in that vprore, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that his armie was diſtributed by quarters, diſperſed here and there, by reaſon they were not then encamped. Then euery man on both ſides came to ſéeke the aduantages of place &amp; fight, and many good blowes were giuen, and many valiant déedes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the which I will not ſet downe particularly. While that theſe things were doue, the Admirall perceyued that the armye of <hi>Monſieur</hi> was all paſſed, and came forwarde on the leſt hande as faſt as they coulde, the which was the verye meane for to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the Proteſtantes betwéene the riuer and the armie of the Catholikes. Then he ſéeing no meane left for to retire without fight, commaunded <hi>la Tour</hi> to make the companies of the auant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to aduaunce forwarde, the which he did, and bare himſelfe ſo, that his horſe being borne vnto the grounde, he was taken, and being knowne for him that had ſlayne Captaine <hi>Charry</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> was ſlayne in the fielde, with many other that had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter market.</p>
            <p>Nowe the armie of the Catholikes ranne ouer a great part of the fielde vpon the left hande, where ſtoode the troupes of <hi>Soubize, La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g villier, Puivant, Creſſonierre,</hi> and many other Captains in chiefe of <hi>Poitou,</hi> who thinking that they ought not any longer to expect any occaſion for a better charge, ſéeing that the Catholikes ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced themſelues euery moment, with the aduiſe of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, charged vpon the foremoſt with ſuch furie, that they made them to recule: but being broken by the ſuccours that came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them without ceaſe, <hi>Soubize</hi> and <hi>Long villien</hi> were taken, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanchere</hi> and <hi>Brandaniere,</hi> and many other were ſlaine in the fielde.</p>

            <p>In the meane time his Excellence woulde come another way, for being deſirous to break them in many places at once, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an other waye on the righte hande to be learned out, whiche although it were harde ynough for the nature of the place, yet neuertheleſſe he founde it more eaſie on that ſide, where he made the moſt part of his armie to marche, by reaſon that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes who hitherto maintayned the acuantage of the Baye of the Poude, after that they knewe his enterprice, did abandon it, that they themſelues might retire ſafely. Moreouer, at the ſame inſtant one regiment of <hi>Reyſters</hi> was commaunded to paſſe ouer the Bay, for to ſtrayne them on the ſide, the which they did very luſtily. When all theſe troupes were paſſed for to aduance them ſelues, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> with thrée or foure hundreth horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, turned heade againſt them, and gaue a verye hote charge, being followed by the moſt parte of his men. So that he being chaſed for deſpite to ſée almoſt all his men fledde, and that the whole armie bare it ſelfe no better, did thruſt in with ſuch furie, that he bare to the grounde, and made to recule all thoſe that durſt to tarie him, vntill ſuch time as his horſe being wounded, he was throwne to the grounde, not being able to do the deuoire that he had well deſired and wiſhed. For the hindermoſt troupes of the Catholikes aduauncing themſelues for to holde vppe the foreneſſe (who gaue backe) and being ayded by the <hi>Almaine</hi> horſemen, did thruſte in ſo furiouſly through the Proteſtantes, that two thirdes of them reſted vpon the place, eyther deade or fore hurt.

But the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:15177:152"/>cauſe why that the Admirall (who in déede ruled and gouerned the armie, the Prince being ſcarce a man in yeares) being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched in number, ioyned in battell, was firſt neceſſitie (bicauſe he coulde not commodiouſly neither go backe nor forward, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> was ſo neare vnto him) and ſecondly, deſire of reteyning the auncient honour and reputation of the Proteſtantes, who were alwayes accounted verye hardie and valiant: but if that they ſhoulde nowe haue fled, they might perhaps haue alienated from them the heartes of manye of their fauourers, both in forreine countries, and alſo at home. The place where this battell was darreyned, was a playne called <hi>Cron,</hi> halfe a French leage from <hi>Moncountour,</hi> and two from <hi>Eruaux.</hi> This playne in ſome parts is charged with little hilles, whom the Captaines might orawe to great aduantages for the future battell, as the Admirall did: who hauing marked that towardes the place where his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence woulde come, the playne ended in certayne little hilles with ſmall and ſwéete diſcents, he purpoſed to place there the greateſt part of his footemen, and certaine <hi>Reysters,</hi> bicauſe that they (by reaſon they doe march in the forme of a battallion) are more ſubiect vnto the mercye of the Canon, than the Frenche horſemen (of whome, bicauſe they march and fight in length in the forme of wings, one péece of ordinance can hit but one, and him to very ſeldome:) and alſo for to lodge his ordinance on the ſmall hilles that were at the ende of the plaine, he made the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell too aduaunce more on the right hand, as if he woulde take to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <hi>Eruaux,</hi> whereof he gaue the charge vnto <hi>Lodowick</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te <hi>de Naſſau,</hi> to whome he deliuered thrée Canons and one Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerine.</p>
            <p>The auauntgarde was on the left hande drawing towardes the riuer a little leſſe forwarde than the battell, whereof he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did take the charge and conduct, hauing with him <hi>Puygreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, la Noué, Telignie,</hi> and certaine other, who had the charge of two Canons, two Longues, two Muſchats: And the Conte <hi>de Mansfelde</hi> (the Chiefe of the <hi>Reysters</hi>) of whome he had diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted almoſt the one halfe into the battell, as alſo of Lanſquenets, whom <hi>Granuillrers</hi> conducted. All of whome hauing kiſſed the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:15177:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>grounde, made proteſtations one vnto another, for to enter-ſuccour eche one the other, and to dye in the place rather than to recule and giue backe.</p>
            <p>The Admirall hath had one faſhion very familiar (if it be not to be called a ſtrategemme of warre) which is in generall fight and battell aranged, for to enlace the footemen with the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in this ſort. After he had choſen the beſt footemen for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fans perdus,</hi> he woulde ſet them in the heade of euerye ranke of horſemen, for to ſhoote and that too with aſſurance at the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that woulde come to encounter his horſemen: ſeeing that euerye harquebuſier might alwayes according vnto the place, the time, and the perſons, recharge thrée or foure tunes. As alſo it is not poſſible but that the rankes of the horſemen on the other ſide muſt be well leſſened, and made thynner, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that their partie comming vppon the enimie to recharge them, ſhall (if they be good men) haue ſuch an hande of them as they will themſelues. Neyther are the footemen that begun the attache, thereby in any diſtreſſe or daunger, for their horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will defende them if anye will recharge them: and in the meane time they will finde meane to ſaue themſelues if they be alone on a plaine, or elſe couer themſelues with ſome baſkets or trenches if the places be proper therefore. Here he practiſed againe this forme of fight, but a little altered from the former, as we ſhall declare vnto you.</p>
            <p>In diſpoſing of his horſement, he ſeparated the Cornettes as well French as <hi>Almaines,</hi> intermedling two of <hi>Reiſters,</hi> wyth two of French, as the hindermoſte rankes of the auantgarde were.

On the left ſide of thoſe French Cornettes, was Captayne <hi>Ramiers</hi> with his company of harquebuſiers, for to ſerue for <hi>Enfans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and on their ſide fiue and twentie or thirtie harquebuſiers on horſebacke of the garde of <hi>D'acier:</hi> all theſe harquebuſiers ſtoode a little more forwarde than the Cornettes. More higher,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:15177:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>drawing alwayes towards the right hand was the domeſticall Cornet of the Admirall, and two or thrée other, that he himſelfe woulde conduct, flanked on the one ſide with foure or fiue Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets <hi>Almaines,</hi> ouer whom <hi>Mansfelde</hi> commaunded, and on the other, with two companies of harquebuſiers of <hi>Doge,</hi> and an other captaine. But foure or fiue companies ſhoulde fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Admirall, who were therefore a little farther aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The reſt of the auantgarde ſtill aduauncing themſelues, a little more forwarde in forme of batallions, euen vnto <hi>Mony</hi> and <hi>la Noué,</hi> who were in the heade or fronte with their regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, were followed by the lyke number of <hi>Reyſters.</hi> And ſo likewyſe was the battell aranged, the which was in aray ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding higher on the right hande, drawing towarde <hi>Eruaux.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that all theſe troupes did one ſtande more forward than another, yet this was not in right lyne and in heade, but brawing towarde a directe line, to the ende that the Admirall who ſtoode at the bottome and ende of all his troupes, might ſée a farre, the diſpoſition, countenaunce, and diſmarche of the Catholikes, and vppon a ſodeyne puruey according to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence.</p>
            <p>But although that all theſe troupes were ſo varied and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced, yet neuertheleſſe they might go to the charge all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, or a part, as they woulde themſelues, without one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching of the other, namely ſéeing the <hi>Reiſters,</hi> had requeſted, that they might not be any whit hindred at their firſt diſmarch. For the <hi>Reiſter</hi> vſing another and diuers waye and maner of fight from the Frenchman, in incountring his enimie, can not endure any troupe to be neare him: bicauſe they will breake his courſe: for the <hi>Reiſter</hi> fighteth in this ſorte. When he doth ſée himſelfe neare ynough vnto his enimies, the firſte ranke doth aduaunce vpon them, and when he hath ſhot off his Piſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, he doth not runne ſtill in forwarde (as doth the Frenche man, who doth ſtill purſue his point) but more ſhorte on the right hande, or on the lefte, according vnto the place where he is, and ſo is alſo ſpéedilye followed by the ſeconde ranke, that doth the verye ſame. Then the thirde followeth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:15177:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>to giue the charge, as ſoone as euer he ſéeth him departed that ſtoode before him. All the rankes following one another, in ſuch maner, euen vnto the laſt, the hindermoſte runneth (they fighting with Piſtolets onely) for to come vnto their fore ryders, they ſtanding all along one at anothers tayle. And for as much as it is impoſſible, but that when they doe preſent themſelues, ſome of them, or elſe their horſes be ſlaine: therefore as ſoone as euer one of the foremoſt ranke is ſéene to fall downe, he that is in the ſeconde ranke, directlye behinde him that is departed, or elſe diſabled, muſt take his place, and he of the thirde ranke muſt furniſhe the voyde place of the ſeconde, and ſo the reſt in lyke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo that they alwayes make their foremoſte rankes, of the moſt aſſured: for in all things (namely in feates of armes) the beginning is of greateſt moment.</p>
            <p>You ſee the reaſon why the Admirall had thus diſpoſed hys men: neyther was this forme and diſpoſition profitable, onelye for this regarde, but alſo was very auantagious for the <hi>Reiſters.</hi> For the French horſemen woulde impeache them that woulde come againſt their <hi>Reiſters,</hi> from ouerrunning or breaking them, and alſo woulde giue them large libertie to recharge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the encounter. And on the other ſide, when the French men ſhoulde ſée that the <hi>Reiſters</hi> Catholikes charged their <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and namely when they ſhould turne (as alſo the <hi>Reiſters</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants woulde doe) to recharge their Piſtolettes, then woulde they run vpon them luſtilye, and breake them at their eaſe, I ſay, that all of them ſhoulde not haue leyſure to recharge. For ſéeing they haue nothing to fight with but their Piſtolets, when they haue diſcharged, they are halfe deade, and namely when they ſée their rankes broken. In this battayle, the <hi>Reyſters.</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes and Proteſtants entercharged one the other: but if that lot had giuen, that the <hi>Reiſters</hi> Catholikes had charged the French men, they might eaſily haue bene broken. For the Frenchman that ſtill followeth his point, doth eaſily breake that ranke of the <hi>Reiſters,</hi> which he findeth going about to rally and recharge. And through this forme of fight many <hi>Reiſters</hi> Catholikes ended their dayes in this iourney, and not onely by this meane, but alſo by
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:15177:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>that which I haue before declared: that is to wit, the ſhotte of the harquebuſiers on foote, that were intermedled with the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Such was the diſpoſition and ordinance of the horſemen of the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>As for the footemen, thoſe that were in the auantgarde, were inmaſſe or plumpe, hauing the forme of one groſſe battallion, which the Lanſquenets made vnder the charge of the Baron of <hi>Greneleſee,</hi> and of <hi>Granuilliers,</hi> flanked on two ſides with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of harquebuſiers Frenchmen, ledde by <hi>Piles, Rouiuray, Briquemaut</hi> the younger, <hi>de Ambres,</hi> and <hi>du Chellar.</hi> Moreouer, this battell was ſuſteyned by foure troupes of horſemen, as well Frenchmen as <hi>Reiſters,</hi> ordered as I haue ſhewed before. The footemen of the battayle made another battallion, compoſed of the harquebuſiers of the regiments of <hi>Beaudine, Mombrun, Blacons, Mirabel,</hi> and <hi>Virieu,</hi> ſuſteyned as before. And alſo theſe two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of footemen had their harquebuſiers in their front, who (as <hi>Enfans perdus</hi>) ſhoulde giue and receyue the firſt blowes, as they were conducted by their Captaines who wente before them. They had not one Pyke among them, a weapon the beſt and moſt neceſſarie that a footeman can deuiſe to beare, and ſuch an one for a footman, as the Launce is for an horſeman, as we will ſhewe at another time, by Gods helpe.</p>
            <p>The Colonels and Captaines of euery bande were a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced for to encourage their men: all the armie was clothed in white. The Proteſtants ſtoode ſtill, not mouing out of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and it ſéemed that they woulde haue bene well contented to haue bene diſpenced with for fighting that day, the which thing ſome men aduiſed. Yet many preſuming that which afterward hapned vnto them, ſayde: that a Generall which hath his troupe readie for the ſhocke, ought not to ſtay for the charge, and that this had alwayes bene holde for an aſſured <hi>Maxime</hi> among the old Fores of times paſt. And for proofe more certaine, the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates themſelues had marked, that in all fightes paſt, they had done better when they charged firſt, than when they expected the diſmarch of the Catholikes.</p>
            <p>Nowe you haue ſéene the eſtate and diſpoſition wherein the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:15177:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>armie of the Proteſtants, expected that of his Excellence, who by the aduiſe of the moſt olde practiſed warriours of his troup, diſpoſed his armie after the manner that I ſhall tell you. He being a little aduaunced in the playne, and hauing cauſed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the principall Captaynes to come vnto him, diſpoſed his troupes after the Frenche faſhion, whiche is to deuide the maſſe of an armie into two parts, which they doe call an auant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, and a battell. Diuers times if that the armie be verye great, they make thrée, and to theſe two adioyne a rerewarde, for to ſuſteyne thoſe two foremoſte troupes, if they ſhoulde chaunce to be ouerthrowne, and to ſuccour the bands that ſhall haue néede: and alſo for to reallye, as well thoſe that for long fight haue loſt or ſtragled from their Engſines, or for to ſtaye them that flée, and to conſtrayne them to make heade. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantgarde was compoſed of horſemen, as well Frenchmen as <hi>Almaines</hi> and <hi>Italians.</hi> Of Frenchmen were the Prince <hi>Dauphin,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guiſe, Martigues, Chauigny, la Valette,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captaines: the troupe of whome was no leſſe than two or thrée thouſande horſemen.

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:15177:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>aduaunced (after the Frenche faſhion) a good number of yong men as well horſemen as footmen, for to ſcrue for <hi>Enfans perdus,</hi> and attach the fight firſt. Ouer all theſe commaunded the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> who made his auantgarde to kéepe this order. The <hi>Switzes</hi> and their flankes of harquebuſiers, as men readye to come to the charge, were ſet vpon the right hand, and before them aduaunced <hi>Martigues,</hi> who ſhoulde charge firſt, after that the <hi>Enfans perdus</hi> of the horſemen, whom he had before him, had giuen their firſt charge. <hi>Martigues</hi> was followed by the Prince <hi>Dauphin,</hi> who being accompanied with <hi>Chauigny,</hi> hadde on his righte hande the Conte <hi>de San Fiora, Marie</hi> and <hi>Paule Sforza,</hi> brothers, with <hi>Charles de Birague</hi> followed by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, for the moſt part <hi>Italians.</hi> Behinde the Prince for to ſuſteyne all that were before, marched the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> hauing on his ſide two thouſande <hi>Reiſters,</hi> conducted by the <hi>Lantgraue</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> the two Contes <hi>Reingraffe,</hi> brothers, the Conte <hi>de VVeſtambourg, de Baſſompierre,</hi> and <hi>Scomberg,</hi> who ledde eyghtene Cornets.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:15177:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>twelue hundreth horſe, whome the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> had ſent, the Marques of <hi>Baden,</hi> who had about one thouſande, and certayne other particulars.

All theſe battallions had their <hi>Enfans perdus</hi> in their front, as I haue ſayde of the auantgarde.</p>
            <p>Nowe ye ſhall ſée the order that euerye companie hath in the battell for to diſmarch, when that the ſignall of fight ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. I will take my beginning at the perſon of his Excellence, for the good lucke that he brought vnto the whole armie. <hi>Monſieur</hi> woulde be betwéene the Marques of <hi>Baden,</hi> and the Regiment of the <hi>Switzers.</hi> And therefore when it was vppon the point of the charge, he commaunded Duke <hi>du Aumalle</hi> to leade the <hi>Reiſters</hi> of the Marques, who were on the right hande. Mareſchall <hi>de Coſſe</hi> with his companies, and the Conte <hi>de Mansfelde</hi> with his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nettes garded the <hi>Switzers</hi> on the left ſide.

               </gap>her, &amp; at one time (as it alſo now happened:) for the auantgarde of his Excellence had no ſooner marched, but that the battell whiche <hi>Monſieur</hi> himſelfe conducted, began to buſkle theſelues to go vnto the charge, as I ſhall tell you hereafter, otherwiſe than the moſt part of the auncients haue vſed to doe, whoſe battels did moſte commonly attende the happy or vnhappye ſucceſſe of the auant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde.

            <p>It is to be noted, that his Excellence had encharged <hi>Biron</hi> to make readie the battels, whileſt that he being accompanied with the Dukes <hi>de Aumalle, Longville, Coſſe, Tauennes, Villars, Faye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But bicauſe he was counſayled not to go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he retired. Then <hi>Tauannes</hi> (on whoſe iudgement he repoſed himſelfe for the conduct of his armie) ſuppliantly deſired him to let him alone in going further, that he might be able to giue vnto him more certaine aduiſe. He hauing ouerrun with his diligent eye the principall of the armie Proteſtant, came to finde <hi>Monſieur</hi> and aſſured him of the good fortune that he ſhoulde haue, if it woulde pleaſe him to giue battell. But if (ſayde he) we ſhall neglect it now, another time the like will not be offred vs, nor an occaſion of ſo great aduantage. Let them marche in the name of God with all diligence, without breaking the order of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels. The which aduiſe was receyued of his Excellence, giuing God prayſe, and with very great chearefulneſſe (as his face ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to teſtifie) and the enterpriſes that he tooke in hand did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe afterwarde vnto all thoſe that did followe him.</p>
            <p>The two armies were not ſo ſoone in a readineſſe, but that they diſcouered one the other all in groſſe anon after eyght of the clock on Monday morning. Then the Canon of the battell Proteſtant began to play, ſhooting ſo right, that it loſt not one ſhoote. Thoſe
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:15177:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Catholikes anſwered them ſoone inough with a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noyſe, but with leſſe dommage: for moſtlye they ſhotte too lowe, or too high, and alſo the footemen, and the moſte part of the horſemen of the Proteſtantes, laye ſo vnder the defence of the playne in the little valleys that were in that quarter, that of thrée ſhottes, the Catholikes loſt one or two although they alwayes ſhot thrice againſt once of the Proteſtants. The artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie of the auantgarde came alſo at the ſame time to ſalute one another, and interaunſwere and debate who ſhoulde vomite moſt bloude, moſt ſlaughters, and moſt miſchiefes, doing equal deuoyre vnto the ordinance of the battels.</p>
            <p>Whileſt that the great thunder made it ſelfe to be hearde in all quarters, many horſemen diſbanded themſelues out of their rankes as well of the one partie as the other, ſome for to ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe, other for to ſée the effect of the Canon, and ſome for to vewe more better and nearely the ſcite, and the forme of the Campe of their aduerſaries: yea, and there were alſo ſome that ſought out their kinſefolkes and frendes, and talked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither as well of the euent of this iourney, as of the occaſions that had moued them to followe that part which they maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but the beſt aduiſed woulde not departe from their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, both bicauſe they woulde not put themſelues in the mercie of the Canon, who taking from him the féete and heade of his horſe, woulde make him looſe the good happe to aſſiſte ſo notable a battell, as alſo for that they conſidered, that they had alredy inough to doe for their parts, and that one ought not to wearie himſelfe before the time of fight, and to tire his horſe, as <hi>Vegece</hi> mocketh pleaſantly ſome Romaynes of his, who wold come vnto the fight quite out of breath. <hi>Tauannes</hi> who had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the commoditie of all places of the fielde, and the wayes of all the quarters, tolde <hi>Monſieur</hi> that it was néedefull to make the battels to retire a little on the lefte hande, as well to take the large and aduantagious fielde, to the ende to haue greater eaſe and libertie to fight, and to cut off the way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Proteſtants, if they would retire towards their conqueſts, as alſo for to ſaue the troupes from the furie of the artillerie, the which did mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylouſly
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:15177:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>endammage them.</p>
            <p>The which gaue occaſion vnto the Admirall to chaunge the encamping of al his troupes, and to ſtand more on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right hand vpon the waye to <hi>Moncontour,</hi> and <hi>Eruaux,</hi> as it were to make a barre for the Catholikes, if that they would thruſt in to paſſe further that waye. Therevpon his Excellence commaunded Duke <hi>de Montpenſier</hi> who ledde the auantgarde for to marche, &amp; the Mareſchal <hi>de Coſſé,</hi> who ſtoode on the left ſide of the battalion of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> to make the battell drawe a little more on the left hande than it was. The which they executed very readilye, and knewe very well to chooſe a place for to aduauntage their armie. Yet though this commaundement were receyued, they marched not immediatly: for it is to be preſumed, that euerye Captaine would then recogniſe &amp; encourage his men, and open vnto them the occaſions and meanes to fight fortunatly. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, euery companye was preached vnto by their Preachers, namely for the regarde of the Proteſtants, after that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and <hi>Condé,</hi> had adhorted them to do their deuoire, to conſider the conſequence of ſuch a iourney, the foule ignomy or moſt renoumed reputation that they ſhould get by the euent of ſuch a battell, wherin lay thoſe things that euery man of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did ſéeke, that is to wit, their goodes, their honour, their whole ſtate, their liues, &amp; their conſciences, which is of farre greater price, &amp; therfore ſith by the wel or ill doing in this iourney, their life or death was aſſured, they in ſumme prayed them to follow their captains, who would not fayle to lead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a very good way.</p>
            <p>Then after that <hi>Tauennes</hi> (whome his Excellence had before ſent for, to learne when it was time for to go vnto the charge) had reported vnto him, that it was very good time, and that he muſt preſently giue in, bicauſe the artillerie of the Proteſtants maruallouſly enda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maged the Catholikes, &amp; namely that of the battel, which lay within an hundreth paces of the battallion of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> &amp; gaue it a very ſhrewd check: &amp; again, the artillerie of the Catholikes, by reaſon of the place (as I haue ſaid) did but a litle harme vnto the Proteſtants, for the cauſes before diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Moreouer he told him how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day paſſed away, which might
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:15177:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>empeache the obteyning of an entiere victorie: and in déede the armies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whileſt that the Canon thus played ſtill as well on the one part as the other, his Excellence commaunded the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> to go reſolutely to the charge, &amp; he himſelfe would alſo doe the ſame in his quarter. The which was done as ſoone as the artillerie of the one and the other ſide was ſodenly retired by the ſides, and euery companie (according to the order afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde) did put themſelues in pace, and at the ſame inſtant the Trumpets of the Proteſtants hauing ſounded <hi>Dedans, dedans, tis, tis,</hi> the armie began to march, ſéeing the Catholikes now ſetting forwarde, for to go on to the encounter.</p>
            <p>Vpon this, the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> commaunded <hi>Martigues</hi> for to charge the runners or <hi>Enfans perdus,</hi> and ſo to beginne the game, &amp; ſtaying them at the firſt. The which they did: for being ioyned with the <hi>Italians</hi> &amp; certain French troupes, they marched as though they woulde haue giuen vpon the <hi>Enfans perdus</hi> of the footomen of the Proteſtantes, but they no ſooner ſaw themſelues ſaluted by two or thrée hundreth harquebuſiers, but that they turned very ſhort on the left hande, and chaunging their trot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a gallop, gaue ſo feruently vpon <hi>Mouy</hi> and his regiment, that he being abandoned and forſaken by the two Cornets of <hi>Reiſters,</hi> that had bene appoynted to followe them, and his regiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken, was forced to get him away, and to ſaue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of his men among the footemen, who being made mad with ſo piteous an accident, and foreiudging a miſerable ende of ſo vnhappy a beginning, loſt their harts, &amp; diſbending themſelues by little &amp; litle, in the ende ranne all away for the beſt game. The <hi>Enfans perdus</hi> were the firſt, who by ſo doing helped much to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the other, ſo that they almoſte altogither forſooke the Lanſquenets. At the ſame time, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and <hi>la Valerie</hi> being followed by many other companies, aduaunced themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues luſtilye, and came a great trotte to charge their parrie, who with the ſame pace haſted to attache them. At the meeting, many Launces flewe into ſhiuers, many horſes to the hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>While that theſe troupes fought with ſo great pertinacie, the Conte of <hi>Saint F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing further, gaue vpon the reſt, who being diſperſed here and there without Captaine, were not able to abide the impreſſion of the French men of armes, who bowing themſelues vppon the incitation of their Launce, and being borne by ſtrong horſes, buried many vnder their bellies: yet theſe encounters were not done without ſending of many of the one part and the other, for to take the meaſure of their tombe vpon the duſte of that fielde, and namely of the Catholikes, whome the harquebuſiers that were on the ſide of the Proteſtants, ſet off at all libertie, aſſuring themſelues, that after they had diſcharged, the horſemen woulde giue the charge vpon their partes, and in the meane time they ſhoulde haue leyſure inough to prouide for their affaires.</p>
            <p>Yet neuertheleſſe for all this, the Admirall, who by reaſon of his great practiſe in armes, the which the long courſe of his olde yeares, and (which is more) the diligent marking of ſo great and ſo diuers euents as had runne before his eyes, as he followed the warres as well abroade as at home, coulde welneare certainely iudge what would be the euent of the battell, counſelled the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to retire as couertly, and with as ſmal a trayne as they could: but as in aduerſitie men haue their eyes more ſtirring, and their ſpirites more liuely to eſpie, and prie on all ſides, the meanes and wayes howe to enfranchiſe themſelues from an yll chaunce
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:15177:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>that approcheth them neare, many horſemen followed them, ſo that they ſawe more ſeruitors at their tayles by one halfe, than the ordinarie trayne of their houſes woulde beare, the whiche helped nothing to encourage them that ſawe, or hearde after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of that retraite: the which made them ſo much the more to ſuſpect that ſome yll happe was neare, as the thing had bene ſecret vnto them. I leaue to rake after theſe <hi>Villiaques,</hi> who did abandon their enſignes, for to followe them that commaunded them not, and I will ſpeake only of thoſe that were moſt chafed for to fight. All theſe fellowes being empeached by rickling one another ſo neare, coulde not ſée at all the diſmarches, and the cruell affronts of two thouſand <hi>Reiſters</hi> Catholikes, and of the companies that aſſiſted the Admirall, as well Frenchmen as <hi>Almaines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When theſe battallions ſawe that they were nere to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, the Proteſtats cauſed their harquebuſiers to auance, crying vnto them that they ſhould not ſhoote but at the horſes, but with all aſſurance. The whiche although they did, &amp; ſhot off at fiftie pace, the foremoſt giuing place vnto thoſe that folowed, yet they coulde not ſhoote off ſo ſoone, but that the <hi>Reiſters</hi> were already come to the charge. The foremoſt of whome directing their ranges to run vpon the French Proteſtants, who were on the ſide of their <hi>Reiſters,</hi> were couragiouſly receiued and ouerrun at the firſt blowe, as well bicauſe the nature of the Frenchman is ſuch, that if he once ioyne, he will ſtill go farther, as alſo for that the harquebuſiers had already well clered and thinned the rankes of the <hi>Reiſters,</hi> by ſlaying and hurting many before hand, who were able to giue no farther forward, than the place where they had bene ſo nearely touched. The <hi>Reiſters</hi> Catholykes not marching togither, nor charging with one and the ſame trot, but being diſtributed by regiments, and ſuſteyned by French horſemen, the one companie of them attached the Admirall, who was aſſiſted by the Conte of <hi>Mansfelde,</hi> and the other char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the two companies of men of armes of the Admirall, and <hi>de Acier,</hi> who were followed by two or thrée Cornets of <hi>Reiſters.</hi> Theſe charges were hote and very furious for all men an both
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:15177:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſides, and much more cruell on the ſide of the Catholikes, than on the other, by meanes of the harquebuſiers Proteſtants, who liuely taſted the Catholikes. Some died in the field, other felte themſelues ſo hurt, that they were not able to go any further, neyther had any ſtrength to fight. And bicauſe of the crie, At the horſes fellowes, at the horſes: Many of the beaſtes were ſo pricked to the quicke, that they coulde neuer ſerue afterwarde.</p>
            <p>When that theſe footmen had giuen euery man his blow they founde the horſes of the artillerie who were retired into that quarter neare vnto them, I doe beléeue they were not ſlouthfull to vſe them, preſaging (it may be) the fearefull and long flight which they were neare vnto. The reſt prouided, and made the beſt ſhifte for themſelues that they coulde. At that charge the Admiral was hurt betwéene the noſe and the ball of the chéeke, through the fault of thoſe companies that had bene ordeyned for to couer him, and fight before him, who bicauſe they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the charge ſooner than they ought, he founde himſelfe ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled among the Catholikes, that if the Conte <hi>de Mansfeld</hi> (retaking the charge, and with him foure or fiue Cornettes of <hi>Reiſters</hi>) had not repulſed them, the Admirall had neuer got out, but had come vnto the curteſie of them that loued him little. This being done, the one and the other retired a little for to ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye themſelues vnder their enſignes, and afterwarde to returne to the encounter.</p>
            <p>This firſt rencounter was mortall vnto manye Catholikes, through the meanes and occaſions aforeſayde, ſo that they ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to leaue the Confederates almoſt in the poſſeſſion of good fortune. For in doede ſome of them then aduancing themſelues vpon the Catholikes, cried out, victorie, victorie as though ſhe had ſlipped out of the handes of his Excellence. But this crye profited the Proteſtants nothing: for it ſéemed that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes had no leſſe aſſuced themſelues of their forces, than of the good houre that aſſiſted them, as you ſhall heare. Yet bicauſe they were ſeene to be put to flight, it made manye enſignes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a great number of Catholikes to retire, whom the Proteſtantes rallying themſelues vnder their Enſignes,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:15177:160"/>thought to haue charged, if that a freſhe r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ment that made as though they woulde charge the Proteſtantes their <hi>Reiſters,</hi> (who had now rallyed themſelues) had not cauſed them to ſtay.</p>
            <p>But bicauſe ye haue your eyes ſo faſt fixed on the ſlaughters of the auantgardes, ye cannot ſée howe the battell diſmarcheth by the commaundement of his Excellence. Whoſe great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie coulde not ſuffer ſo long reſt, &amp; although he were vncertaine of the ſucceſſe of his auantgarde which was nowe come to hande ſtrokes, yet he durſt to leaue his tranquilitie, and abandon all his whole ſtate vnto the greatneſſe of his fortune, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vntill that day, ſmyled full merily vpon him. Séeing then that he coulde not abide to expecte vntill the footemen had begun the game, he made a ſodaine departure from the right ſide vnder the conduct of the Duke <hi>de Aumalle,</hi> the Marques of <hi>Baden,</hi> and with all his <hi>Reisters,</hi> the which Marques ranne in ſo farre before the reſt, that he was there ſlayne, and many other, for compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his mortall charge. Yet this was a ſmall matter: but <hi>Monſieur</hi> himſelfe, whether his nature hote and boyling in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall prowes, did ſollicite him to enter the battell, or whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to laye the armie of the Proteſtantes on the grounde, pricked him therevnto: did no ſooner ſée the Confederates buſkle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to fight, but that he marched full vpon the diſcouert of the artillerie, the which had not ceaſed, neither did then ceaſe to play, as well in the Eſquadron of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> as of other, and namely in that of the footemen, and his Excellence aduaunced himſelfe ſo luſtilye vpon the Proteſtantes, that the <hi>Switzers</hi> vnder Colonell <hi>Phiffer,</hi> and their Generall <hi>Mern,</hi> with the other battallions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned a great way behinde him. Nowe ſéeing that ſuch a <hi>Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur</hi> went ſo feruently to the charge, the encounter maye not bée thought to be other than furious. But (as I haue ſhewed before) he founde an other order and medley of men of warre than he had thought. Firſt and foremoſt his Excellence was ſaluted by foure ſcore or an hundreth harquebuſiers on horſebacke, that there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered themſelues. Furthermore, when that the horſemen had aſſured themſelues that the harquebuſiers had giuen a greate check to his troupe, and that the <hi>Reisters</hi> had alſo done much more
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:15177:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>miſchiefe, the Frenchmen did caſt themſelues heade, féete, and handes, as it were deſperately into his Eſquadron, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in euen to the Cornet, made all them that had followed his Excellence to forſake the place, for all the deuoyre, and all the force that the Duke of <hi>Long ville, Tauannes, Carnauallet, Villars,</hi> and all thoſe that had followed and accompanied him coulde make, and all that euer they coulde doe: in ſumme, this charge was ſo terrible, that the moſt aſſured enſignes beganne nowe to turne backe againe, as if they woulde demaund ſuccour of Mareſchall <hi>de Coſsé,</hi> who had not yet departed one foote from the left ſide of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and had auaunced them forwarde apace, for to be in time as he himſelfe was, for to ſuccour their fellowes. And to ſay the truth, if he had not bene, the battell had bene then ended. And one may truly note in him, that all his enterpriſes, bicauſe they neuer were none of thoſe haſtie and lightly aduaunced, were alwayes valiantly and fortunately executed, as things mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliberated, are alwayes moſt ſure in execution.</p>
            <p>All in time <hi>Tauannes</hi> ranne to the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and made them to come a trot to giue the charge, their Colonell <hi>Mern</hi> marching before them. The Mareſchall <hi>de Coſsé,</hi> the yong <hi>Briſac</hi> aduauncing forwarde, made the Proteſtants to ſtaye ſomewhat, who mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated their pace a little, that they might rallye themſelues, and charge thoſe that came freſh. In fine the Conte <hi>Lodowick</hi> with his troupes as well French as <hi>Almaines,</hi> gaue luſtily vpon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchall <hi>de Coſsè,</hi> Conte <hi>de Mansfelde, Tauannes,</hi> and other, that flanked the left ſide of the <hi>Switzers:</hi> it was very valiantly fought on the one ſide and the other, as well with blowes of Launces and Coutelas, as of Piſtolettes. The impetuoſitie and furie of the which Piſtolets, doth not permit our ſlaughter in fight to endure ſo long as it did in auncient time. For then euerye man affronting his aduerſarie, woulde not depart out of the place, before that the happier man had ſlaine his enimie, or made him obedient to his will. But bicauſe we doe aſſure our ſelues more in the diuelrie of our Piſtolets, than in valiant armes, after we haue diſcharged our Piſtolet vpon our enimie, as we runne we doe paſſe further, as the horſe will, eyther for to recharge, or to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:15177:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>take the tucke. And it doth moſt often happen that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies doe find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſo diſperſed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimies after the firſt charge, they muſt tarie a long time to rallye themſelues, expecting the ſeconde encounter, as it here happened: for after they hadde bene well martyred with the firſt impreſſion, they perceyued that they were ſo put out of aray, that they muſt néedes retire for to revnite themſelues. But the Proteſtantes ſéeing themſelues to be ſo ſmall a number, and the Catholikes to be refreſhed and ſtrengthened to the purpoſe, as well by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the Mareſchaur of the Campe, as by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> who were ready to giue the charge, loſt their anger and hatred to recharge.</p>

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:15177:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>although that manye of them with ioyned handes, and knées on the grounde, cried out, <hi>Bon papiſt, bon papist moy,</hi> I am a good Papiſt, I am a good Papiſt. As in déede, no fewe of them were Catholikes, by reaſon of the little acception that ſuch ſorte of people haue, who will firſt giue them intertainement: yet at the length they being wearye rather of ſtryking, than of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, were in the ende conſtrayned to leaue thoſe occaſions of ſighing and wéeping vnto other, who tooke them as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſeruice, for to ſerue them afterwarde as it were their Cuſterels. Of foure thouſande, two hundreth or thereaboutes eſcaped their bloudye handes, and almoſt ſeauen hundreth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who being leſſe armed, and better legged than the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte, and hauing the knowledge to preſage by the beginning of a ſléete, the comming of ſo piteous a ſtorme, had fledde oute of the fielde, with the greateſt part of the French footmen, who (as I haue ſayde) had done the ſame long time before. Neare thrée thouſande harquebuſiers were aranged with theſe Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenets, who had all felt the ſame furie of the victorious, if it had not bene for certaine French Captaines in chiefe, and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> himſelfe, who being a right Gentleman in déede, contented himſelfe with the honor and the happy end of the notableſt vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie that euer was giuen vnto him in Fraunce, and it maye alſo happen, that euer ſhall be afoorded him in any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, commaunding them to pardon the Frenchmen. Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe one thouſande or twelue hundreth dyed there for to enrich the playne of <hi>Cron,</hi> and to ſerue for an eternall marke of the iourney of <hi>Moncontour,</hi> the which the Proteſtants loſt, aſwel through the fault of the hearts of thoſe that fledde, as for the yll diſpoſition and aray of their horſemen.</p>
            <p>For the Generall being curiouſlye carefull to hide the ſmall number of his men, would ſtretch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth in length like vnto an hedge, for to giue apparence vnto the Catholikes that they were farre mo than they were in in déede, and by this meanes to haue made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cold to encounter them, that the iourney nere at hande, might be paſſed ouer in peace, bicauſe he doubted that he ſhuld not therin beare himſelfe well with aduantage, the which
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:15177:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Catholikes gained, being aſſured of his ſtate there, bicauſe they had better diſpoſed their horſes in groſſe battallions, who giuing as it were deſperately through theſe hedges of the whyte Caſſockes, ouerranne them, and put out of the araye the greateſt part of them, notwithſtanding all the hayle of the harquebuſſe ſhot which they made to rayne thicke and thréefolde vpon them. And otherwiſe the <hi>Reislers</hi> were not able to abide the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the French horſemen, bicauſe they fought ſeperated, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vnto their natural and ordinarie faſhion, ſo that they were in the ende broken by the Catholikes. The forme of fight in the maner of an hedge, is good for Frenchman againſt Frenchman, but more proper to one that beareth Launce, than vnto a Piſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letter, who we ſée doe all charge togither, and the hindermoſt do not couer nor hinder the foremoſte: and as this diſpoſition was of no force that daye, ſo let him not vſe it any more hereafter. In ſumme, they loſt very fewe of the horſemen, both for the grace and fauour that their ſpurres gayned thoſe that fledde at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt (for to marke I beléeue their lodgings at <hi>Partenaye,</hi> and then at <hi>Rochel,</hi> and <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> and farther too, if they had durſt to haue gone) and alſo for the fewe charges that they made that remayned and ſtoode to it. Who being vnited quicklye after the firſt and ſeconde charges, retired, the which of truth was more honourable than the fight paſſed, as I ſhall ſhewe you in another place. True it is, that the Catholikes reallying themſelues, made them to remember the iourney or battell of Spurres. But when one hath done his deuoire, the retraite in caſes deſperate, doth carie no diſhonour.</p>
            <p>Such was the ende of the battell, wherein Frenchmen, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, Burgonions, Italians, Switzers, Flemmings,</hi> and Lanſquenets tried ſufficiently the proweſſe and dexteritie of themſelues and other, with leyſure inough. <hi>Henrie Champer now</hi> with his Cornet of Engliſhmen was comming thitherwarde, but being arriued at <hi>Niort,</hi> when the battell was fought, and hauing ſéene theyll happe of this iourney by ſhe long trayne of the fléers, incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe with the maſſe of the eſcaped.

For the Generall neuer ought to trouble his perſon (in whome the good or yll happe of the whole armie doth ſéeme to be repoſed) with the purſuite of them that flee: for as muche as the perill that maye happen, is common vnto him with the meaneſt ſouldiour of his troupes. The purſuit was not long, bicauſe that the Proteſtants being all ioyned togither (as I haue tolde you, and notably ſuſteined by eight or nine Cornets of <hi>Almaines,</hi> with the Conte <hi>Lodowicke</hi> and <hi>Mansfelde</hi> (to whome it is naturall to kéepe better order, whether it be in marche, or in fight, than any other nation that is) durſt ſtaye for the hoteſt of the purſuers: ſo that afterward they went but a marching pace, for when the Catholikes thought to annoy them, ſodenlye this maſſe woulde turne heade, and then they durſt not to runne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them.

In the meane time, euerye man made his moſt heartie and ſuppliant prayers vnto God for the good ſucceſſe of the fight, and then tooke a ſhorte breakefaſt, and alſo the Mariners and rowers being refreſhed with meate and drinke, and anon all of them, &amp; euery one of them with prompt and valiant hearts made ready themſelues for to fight. Two of the galeazes went before the middle battell. <hi>Iohn Andrew Doria</hi> Admiral of the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> fléete had the leading of the right wing, wherein were thréeſcore and foure galleyes, and alſo two of the galeazes went before him. <hi>Augustine Barbadico</hi> was Captayne of the left wing, with fiftie thrée galleyes, and likewiſe two of the Galeazes went before him. But <hi>Andrew Baciano</hi> Marques of <hi>Sancrace,</hi> and Admirall of the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> fléete, who had the leading of the rerewarde, or the battell of ſuccour, ſtoode with his galleyes, who were in number thirtie eyght, halfe a myle from the battelles. But that our men might fight with happy euent, it was wrought through the helpe and ſingular prouidence of God, who made the winde which at the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning did greatlye fauour the enimies their nauie, by little and little to fall, and anon there followed ſuche a calms, that the <hi>Turkiſhe</hi> veſſels coulde ſcarce be ſtirred out of their place, in ſo much that their ſhippes were rowed forth, and in the meane time more leyſure and aduauntage was giuen vnto our men to ſette their araye. The Admirall of the <hi>Turkiſhe</hi> fléete <hi>(Haly Baſſa)</hi> had before this tyme ſente one <hi>Caracoſſe</hi> with a Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine to take a vewe of our nauie, the whiche he reported vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Admirall to be farre leſſe than it was in déede, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bicauſe he coulde not well ſée the galleyes of the lefte
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:15177:166"/>wing, by reaſon of his ſpéedy poſting, or elſe, which is more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the Iſlande that was behinde them. But two other that were ſent after <hi>Caracoſſe,</hi> hauing vewed our fléete more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and curiouſly marked the kings flagges, returned ſpéedilye, and tolde that our nauie was very ſtrong, and very excellentlye well appointed and prepared to fight, with their enſignes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced. But as ſoone as he hearde this, he greatlye maruelled, as he that had before fully perſuaded himſelfe, and alſo the ſame had bene tolde him by <hi>Caracoſſe,</hi> that our nauie was farre leſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was in déede, and therefore woulde our men go backe againe as ſoone as euer they ſawe them comming, and ſeeke their ſafetie by ſhamefull flight, or elſe if that they were ſo fooliſhe hardye as to fight, they woulde receyue a notable ouerthrow. He is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to haue enquired whether that thoſe veſſels which were placed in the front, were <hi>Venetian</hi> or <hi>Spaniſhe,</hi> and when he was aunſwered, that the one was intermired with the other, he was very penſiue, and had thought at the firſt that it ſcarce could haue bene by any meanes poſſible. At the firſt he had thought to haue wintered eyther in the gulfes of <hi>Cataro, Corfu,</hi> or <hi>Cephalenia,</hi> but after that he had lerned for a certaintie that our men had rigged forth a mightie nauie, he returned inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently into <hi>Greece,</hi> where he commaunded newe bandes of ſouldiours to be preſſed forth, and they being ſpéedily embarked in his nauie, the whiche was alſo againe newe furniſhed with victualles and other neceſſary things, he directed his courſe with the reſt of the <hi>Lanizars</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinarie ſouldiers that he had before leuied, towards <hi>Cuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zologri,</hi> which was almoſt midde waye betwéene <hi>Lepanto</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras,</hi> with intent to fight with our fléete, and in that minde was he the more confirmed, for that he had vnderſtoode by <hi>Caracoſſes</hi> wordes, that his nauie was farre the greater. Wherefore at the firſt the <hi>Turkes</hi> began to reioyce, and promiſed themſelues aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red victorie, and ſo great a deſire to fight had inflamed all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that euerye man coueted to go before his fellowes, although it were commaunded vnder payne of death that no man ſhould go before the Admirall galley. They were like vnto a mightie thick woode, and coulde ſcarce be reſtrayned from fight, and when
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:15177:166"/>they ſawe our men come forwarde to fight verye valiantly and couragiouſly, and euery galley to followe the enſignes according to the diſcipline of warre, and in a very goodly order, with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their galleys directed againſt the enimies, they alſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently began to ſet their nauie with greate arte and celeritie, and they had ſo much the more conceyued the victorie in hope, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the winde did at the beginning blowe very commodiouſlye for them, as we haue ſayde before. But for that the beames of the ſunne which ſhined that day very bright, were full in their eyes, they coulde not ſo aptly and commodiouſly order and ſette their veſſels in aray. <hi>Partaw</hi> the Generall of the ſouldiours, and <hi>Haly</hi> the Admirall of the fléete, whiche two did leade the middle battell, had appointed <hi>Mahomet Bey</hi> to be Captaine of the righte wing, with fifty galleys, and with him were <hi>Sirocke</hi> the Preſident of <hi>Alexandria, Caurlaw, Aſiſcau, Dragan, Agadel, Baſſa, Vſtregaſa,</hi> and many other men of great marke. But <hi>Occhialy</hi> had charge of the left wing, with almoſt foureſcore and ten veſſelles, and there accompanied him <hi>Caraiolo,</hi> and <hi>Arabey</hi> his ſonnes, and many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert ſouldiours, and alſo many of the Pirates: and they went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt <hi>Doria:</hi> their wing ſéemed to be much ſtronger than his, and alſo the galleys to be farre mo in number, bicauſe that <hi>Doria</hi> his galleys that were on the lefte hande not farre from the mayne lande, coulde not at the firſt be ſéene. But the principall Chiefetaines themſelues (who were as ye haue hearde, <hi>Haly</hi> and <hi>Partaw</hi>) were garded on both ſides with almoſt as many galleys. And of thoſe noble menne that accompanied them, theſe were part, <hi>Agan</hi> the maiſter of the <hi>Arſenall, Muſtapha Celibi</hi> the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, <hi>Treymontana, Amath Bey,</hi> with his brother, and <hi>Haly</hi> his ſonne, <hi>Amath Aga,</hi> the Captaine of <hi>Teuthrama, Aſsis Caiga,</hi> the gouernour of <hi>Gallipoli, Caracoſſe, Cambey</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Barbaroſſa, Malamur,</hi> the Captaine of <hi>Mitilene, Deli Solyman, Gider</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Scio, Caſſembey</hi> the Lieutenaunt of the <hi>Rhodes, Prouy Aga</hi> the Captaine of <hi>Napoli, Giapar Cilibi</hi> Preſident of <hi>Calaba, Dordag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, Dondomeney, Beribeuole, Oſman, Reul, Agada, Ciaſafer, Dram Rais,</hi> and many other of marke, both for their riches and authoritie, and alſo for their prowes in warrefare. Thus when they ſawe
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:15177:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>our men (the which in déede happen vnto them otherwiſe than they had expected) readye and couragious to fight, they incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentlye aranged their galleyes for the battell, being caſt into the forme of a Croiſant or halfe Moone, as they haue of long time accuſtomed. The Admirall of the <hi>Turkes</hi> verye ſeuerelye commaunded all men, and euery man in the name of <hi>Selim</hi> for to fight without feare, and valiantly againſt their enimies their nauie. If that anye man did forſake the battell, eyther for ſlouth, feare, or anye other cauſe, he and his veſſell, and all that were with him ſhould be incontinently conſumed with fire. In the meane time he commaunded (as our men did) that euerye man ſhoulde repayre incontinently vnto his ranke and order, and kéepe it, ordeining a grieuous payne for all them that ſhuld doe otherwiſe. Moreouer, he aſſembling his men togither, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to be myndefull of their wonted prowes, through the which they had ſo often hitherto put to flight this ſame eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and reduced into their memorie all the noble actes that they had done in former yeares agaynſt <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and his ſonne <hi>Philip</hi> during the reygne of <hi>Solyman.</hi> Moreouer, he briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye repeated all that they had at ſundrye times done agaynſte the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and what they had of late gotten by warres and armes, that is to wit: howe they had augmented the <hi>Turkiſhe</hi> dominions with the kingdome of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Wherefore they ought to remember, that they were alſo nowe to fight wyth thoſe men whome they had ſo often diſcomfited, and that they ſhoulde make a waye and entrie, not onely into <hi>Italie,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhortlye vnto the poſſeſſion of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and therefore they ſhoulde fight valiantly, &amp; aſſuredly truſt that God and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> through whoſe helpe their aunceſtours had ſubdued ſo manye kingdomes and Prouinces, and had broughte backe from the vanquiſhed enimye, ſo manye renowmed victories, woulde alſo be with, and aſſiſte them in this battell. Theſe things and manye ſuche lyke did he ſet before his ſouldiours, with an oration no leſſe graue than eloquent, that thereby his ſouldiours (although he ſawe them of their owne accorde to be ſharply inkindled to fight) might yet be through theſe adhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:15177:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>the more and more accenſed. Nowe was all the daye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte ſpente, when that the nauies on both ſides were made readie to fight. The ennimies fléete was ſette in almoſte the ſame araye that oures was. For the middle battell came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our middle battell, and their wings againſt ours. Our ſixe greate galleyes or Galeazes (as I haue tolde you) wente before, of whome two ſtoode before eyther wyng, as a moſte ſure Bulwarke, and the reſt wente before the myddle bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. Theſe greate Galleyes charging the leaders of the <hi>Turkiſhe</hi> battelles againſt them, did beate the ennemie on all ſides with their ordinaunce, and committed horrible ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But althoughe the <hi>Turkes</hi> had receyued manye greate loſſes by them, and ſawe that their orders and rankes were ſcattered, yet they being paſſed by them, did wyth a certayne marueylous pertinacie and ſtouteneſſe of heart, gette them incontinentlye vnto the Enſignes. So anon the two fléetes ioyned togither in battell, and the highe Admirall gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes of bothe fléetes vſing the ſurpaſſing chearefulneſſe of the Mariners and Rowers, ranne togither with ſo greate force and violence, that their beakes on bothe ſides were ſtrycken off. They foughte valiantlye and variablye for the ſpace of an whole houre, the victorie enclyning vnto nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte, fortune giuing ioyfull hope of proſperous euente, nowe vnto oure men, and then vnto the aduerſaries. And nowe they began to fighte no longer with Arrowes. Dartes, and Gunnes, but encountered cloſe togither with their Swordes. But when our menne had twyce boorded the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhe</hi> Admirall, and had gotten vnto the Maſte, and ſéemed to be maiſters of hir, they were twyce repulſed thence (and not withoute a notable loſſe) by newe ſuccoure that ranne thither. Whyle that theſe thynges are in doing, <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine de Cardona,</hi> ſéeing that <hi>Lewes de Figaroa</hi> the Captayne of the ſtemme of the highe Admirall, had manye of his menne wounded and ſlayne, came ſpéedilye to relieue and ſuccoure him, wyth <hi>Michael de Moncada,</hi> to whome alſo that charge had bene enioyned. But whyleſt that <hi>Bernardine</hi> foughte
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:15177:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>valiantlye at the ſtemme with his ſworde and target, he being ſhot in with thrée pellets, fell downe and dyed the next morning. And in that place were alſo <hi>Peter Zaputha, Lewes de Ferez, Pliege</hi> the father, <hi>Federick de Benauides, Guſman, Philip de Rhodes, Ruide de Mendozza, Iohn de S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At length our men ſtill vrging with ſharpe ſight, and hauing gotten a fauourable aſpect of victorie, did after an houre and an halfes fight diſcomfite the middle battell, and boorded and tooke the Admirall galley, in whome were about fiue hundreth of the noblemen ſlayne, and mo taken and wounded: the Admirall himſelfe while that he encourageth his men, he erecteth thoſe that doe faynt and be fearefull, he confirmeth the couragious, he extolleth to the heauens thoſe that fight valiantly, and promiſeth them great rewardes: finally (whileſt that he executeth no leſſe the charge of an excellent Chiefetaine, than of a ſtout ſouldiour, is ſlayne with a ſmall ſhot that hit him in the heade, the whiche being ſtreightway cut off from his necke, was brought by a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> vnto <hi>Dom Iohn,</hi> who as ſoone as he ſaw it, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded it to be ſet on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poynt of a ſpeare for a ſpace, &amp; held it aloft with his own hande as it were a trophey, and to ſtrike terror into the heartes of the reſt of his enimies, who fought yet very valiantly, &amp; anon were all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> flagges pulled downe, and one of the croſſe hanged out in their place. But although that a principall galley of the enimies ſodenly inuaded the Admirall, when that ſhe had almoſt vanquiſhed hir enimies, yet ſhe had the ſame euent that the reſt had. While that the high Admirals doe moſt fiercely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter eche other, <hi>Partaw</hi> and <hi>Colonna</hi> encountred togither, and euery one of <hi>Colonna</hi> his galleys with the Turkiſhe, ſome with two, and ſome with thrée, as <hi>Colonna</hi> himſelfe, and the Admirall of the <hi>Venetians</hi> had done; &amp; equall almoſt was the prowes of the ſouldiours on both ſides. At the beginning of the encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter, many were ſlayne, but moſt on the enimies part, by reaſon that our men had in euery galley thrée hundreth ſkilfull &amp; verye well practiſed harquebuſiers, and on the other ſide the enimye had verye fewe,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:15177:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>although in ſteade of them there were innumerable archers, and among them ſome on horſebacke, who deadly wounded manye of our menne. But in the meane time the Galleye ſlaues alſo brought no ſmall helpe to the obteyning of the victorie, by hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Dartes and ſtones vpon the enimie. While that the chief Captaynes of the fléetes encounter one the other with ſo bloudy and cruell fight, all veſſels of both nauies doe alſo in all partes furiouſly fight one againſt the other, and <hi>Doria,</hi> and <hi>Occhiali</hi> runne togither. But here was the fight moſt troubleſome and hardeſt, bicauſe that <hi>Doria</hi> had ioined with ſo ſuttle an enimie, and an old beaten Captaine, and one whome he ſawe did recule backe, that he might chooſe that which he iudged woulde be moſt for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage. This was a great impediment, that his counſels and intents coulde not be knowne, nor all the galleyes brought forth at the firſt. But when they at length, though late, came vnto fight: <hi>Doria</hi> fought valiantly, and had with him <hi>Octauian Ganza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, Vincent Vitelli,</hi> and certaine noble men of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who wyth the reſt beſtirred themſelues not laſily. Whileſt that this furious fight continueth, <hi>Lewes de Rechezenes</hi> dealt with <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> to goe out of hande for to ſuccour the right wing, bicauſe he had ſéene and marked that manye of the enimies galleyes that hadde not yet begun to fight, made thither, and alſo that ſundrie of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> his galleyes were ſomewhat farre off. When the Admirall was come, there was a fierce and bloudy fight committed. There were with <hi>Don Iohn, Iohn Vaſques, Coranade, Andrada,</hi> and <hi>Francis Doria,</hi> who fought all verye valiantly, and although that at the beginning fewe of the galleyes followed the Admirall, yet they which had bene appointed to garde hir ſides, did neuer forſake hir. But the Admirall of the <hi>Spaniſhe</hi> fléete chauncing to ſée a galley, wherein were the ſonnes of the Turkiſhe Admirall (whome they thinking to be aliue and well, diligently and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fought for here and there) made in vnto hir, and they fought togither with paſſing prowes, for in the Turkiſhe galley were a great number of valiant men: and in the <hi>Spaniſhe</hi> were, the ſon of the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile, Iohn Velaſco, Alexander de Torelles,</hi> and many other knights of <hi>Arragon.</hi> At that time alſo <hi>Peter Iuſtinian</hi>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:15177:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Admirall of the fléete of the Knightes of <hi>Malta,</hi> a man of verye ſtoute courage and greate valor. being aſſayled by three galleyes, fought ſo valiantlye, that he boorded two of them, and hadde alſo almoſte boorded the thirde, when that other thrée <hi>Turkiſhe</hi> galleys ſeeing the flagge of <hi>Saint Iohn,</hi> did ſpéedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye inuade him on all ſides, and they being ioyned with the other thrée, ſlue almoſt all his men, among whome were fifite Knightes of the religion, who had with maruellous prowes long time ſuſteyned the violent aſſault of their enimies. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that all men thought ſhe had bene quite loſte: when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde vpon a ſodeyne and not without the inſtinct of God) twoo galleyes of his fellowes (that had fought ſo valiantly with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thrée of the ennimies, that they had taken almoſte all of them) ſéeing <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> his galley in greate diſtreſſe and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſpéedilye haſted to helpe hir, whome they deliuered out of all daunger, and founde the Adinirall yet aliue (although he were ſhotte in with thrée arrowes) and ſtill fighting with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appalled heart, at the decke, with thoſe fewe ſouldrours that were left aliue, being caſt into a ring. In the meane time <hi>Occhiah</hi> very hardlye preſſed <hi>Doria</hi> his ſide on all partes with his galleyes, and had nowe taken ten of our galleyes. Whyle that they thus encounter with doubtfull victorie, the araye was broken in the aduerſe parte, and certayne ſmall veſſels fledde out of the battell, whome yet our men did not chaſe, for that it ſéemed to be no matter of anye greate importaunce, but bent their ſtrength directlye towardes that parte which was moſte oppreſſed by the enimie. When <hi>Occhiali</hi> percepued this, he leauing the galleyes whiche be had a little before taken, incontinentlye made towardes the middle battell: but when he ſawe that the middle battell was diſcomfited, and that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> was come thither with his galley to helpe <hi>Doria,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continentlye beganne to thinke of flight. But our menne to interelude him, didde take before hande a certayne place throughe the whiche they had thought be muſt néedes haue paſſed: but he to eſcape the daunger, directed his courſe cloſe vnto the ſhore, and there landed all the menne that were in
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:15177:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>his galleyes, and thus the greateſt parte of them were ſaued by ſwimming. But if it hadde not chaunced that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parte of oure Galley ſlaues (from whome their fetters were that daye taken, and libertie promiſed them, if that they did their ducties luſtilye and faithfullye) hadde not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in thoſe galleyes of the enimie, whiche had bene taken in the battell, not one Turke hadde eſcaped. But nowe manye of them were ſaued by flighte. <hi>Don Iohn, Baciano,</hi> and <hi>Doria</hi> ſpéedilye purſued <hi>Occhial:</hi> vntill that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte night. But he fléeing awaye in the night time wyth Sayles and Oares, accompanyed with ſundrye Galleyes, (for the number was then vncertayne, ſome reporting moe and ſome fewer, but yet the common fame was thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye) eſcaped in ſafetie: neyther coulde it be then certainelye knowne what waye he had taken. But in the meane whyle in another quarter, <hi>Barbadico</hi> and <hi>Mahomet Bey</hi> foughte to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with greate ferocitie. And albeit that euerye one of our menne didde his duetie, and foughte verye valiantlye and couragiouſlye, and ſpeciallye the leader of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and alſo <hi>Antonye Canali,</hi> and <hi>Marke Quirini,</hi> the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenauntes, yet they had receyued greate incommoditie, and doubtleſſe had bene in no ſmall daunger, if <hi>Aluaro Bacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> that ledde the rerewarde, hadde not ſpéedilye come wyth ſuccour. By hys comming, the fighte was farre more ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye renued, and they did charge the aduerſe parte with ſuche force and violence, that they diſcomfited them: wherein they were alſo holpen by a fortunate wynde whiche blewe with vs, and caried the ſmoke of our ordinaunce vppon the ennimye, and didde beate backe theirs vppon themſelues, whereby their ſighte was muche dymmed and obſcured, whereas oure menne ſawe them verye playnelye and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlye. In thys conflicte and fighte were manye ſlayne on bothe ſides. But the manne of moſte renoumed fame and courage, was <hi>Barbadico,</hi> who was ſhotte into the eye with an arrowe, as hée foughte verye valiauntlye and luſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, at what tyme the prowes and manne hoode of the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:15177:170"/>
               <hi>Venetian</hi> Lieutenants, although it were often alſo ſéene at other times, yet then certes did moſt ſpecially appeare. For when they ſawe that <hi>Barbadico</hi> was ſtricken in the eye with a very grieuous wounde, and that he was ſo impeached by the immeaſurable griefe thereof (although that he ſuppreſſed it with ſurpaſſing ſtouteneſſe of heart) that he coulde not anye longer execute that which he had a little before done, ſo ſtoutlye and excellently: they did ſo performe the dueties of ſtoute Captaines and ſouldiours, that nothing was wanting in them. But <hi>Barbadico</hi> died that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not without the ſighing and ſorowe of all good men. It is ſayde that before he died, he aſked which part had the victorie, and being tolde that our men had gotten it, and that <hi>Selyms</hi> nauie was part taken, and part ſunken, and burnt, he gaue immortall thankes vnto God therefore, and immediately after departed moſt ioyfull out of this life vnto the heauenly. I cannot omit one notable acte of <hi>Aluaro Baciano,</hi> that happened in this battell. He ſéeing a mightie Admirall galley of the Turkes to make in luſtilye towardes our Admirall, layde hir aboorde himſelfe, and tooke hir, but not without ſome loſſe of his men, and his owne target was ſhot in with thrée ſmall pellets, and as he fought va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly with hir, there came another ſhip fraught ful of noblemen of <hi>Naples</hi> for to helpe him. Furthermore, it chaunced, that <hi>Iohn de Cardona</hi> the Admirall of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> fléete, and to whome this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was enioyned in all this voyage to go before the fléete with eyght galleys to ſcout and learne the counſels and intents of the enimie, was entred a roade with foure galleyes to execute his office a little before the time of the conſticte: but he returned in good time, euen then when the two fléetes began to ioyne in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and comming vnto his place which had bene before aſſigned, he founde it verye open, inſomuch that he was forced to take it before fiftene of the enimies galleys that approched. For when he noted howe great detriment it woulde bring, if that the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie got in at that gappe, he by fighting with great policie and celeritie, did foreſhutte them from that entrie, neyther did anye one of them enter before that the Admirall came to ſuccour <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> through whoſe and alſo other mens helpe, thoſe galleys were
